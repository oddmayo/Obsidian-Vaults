Here the lowest AIC selected 2 lags

**Granger causality**

![[Pasted image 20221111023238.png]]

Y does not cause X (0.13 > 0.05)

X causes Y (0.0 < 0.05)

**Impulse response function**

X Y

We can see from the response of X to Y that effectively there is causality of Y to X


**Variance decomposition**

![[Pasted image 20221111024221.png]]

Both the dynamics of X and Y are moved by X, nothing is moved by Y
