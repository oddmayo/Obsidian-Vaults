# Expectations, Policy and the Lucas Critique
## Expectations and policy efectiveness
Expectations about future policy, we introduce a price-setting process better than in [[Macro3 - Aggregate Supply]]

They have a crucial impact on the CB's ability to affect the equilibrium
 - Inflation is perfectly anticipated $\pi_{t,t-1}^e=\pi_t \rightarrow y_t=y_t^n$ 
	As soon as $\pi_{t,t-1}^e \neq \pi_t$ (due to unforseen shocks or biased expectations) then $y_t \neq y_t^n$  
 -  *AS curve links output gap to an expectational error*

## The formation of expectations
There are *obstacles* to the formation of perfectly accurate expectations
1. All relevant information is generally not available (consistent with rational expectations)
2. Information processing involve physicial and cognitive costs (more problematic)

### Constant expectations

### Naive expectations

### Rational expectations
Agents shoud use their *knowledge of the system* they operate in when forming expectations, and should thus make no persistent forecasting errors (*unbiased*)

## The Lucas critique
Pre-Lucas analysis: macroeconometric model $\rightarrow$ policy experiment (but this is wrong)
**Critique:** the parameters of reduced forms are not invariant to economic policy (*expectations* and therefore *behavior* change with policy)

By changing its policy rule, the CB has also changed the structural relation between variables

CB naturally concludes from the fact that $\hat{\beta}$, that it can permanently raise $y_t$ by increasing $\Delta \pi_t$. **But this attempt is doomed to failure**  as soons as agents understand the new monetary policy rule.

By seeking to exploit the fact that $\hat{beta}>0$ to stimulate $y_t$, the CB did not percieve that the parameter $\hat{alpha}$ is **endogenous** to its own economic policy
