# Monetary Policy
## Monetary policy implementation
How does the CB implement the intended value of $r_t$ for #inflation_targeting ? [[Macro3 - Aggregare Suply]] The interest rate that affects aggregate demand is the **real interest rate** $r_t$ *but* is not under direct control of the CB plus it has long maturity

The instruments under direct control (linked to $r$) of the CB are:
1. Short-term **nominal interest rate**: $i$
2. Quantity of **reserve money**: $R$

We need to follow *3 steps*:
1. Use the *fisher equation* $\rightarrow$ connect $r$ and $i$
2. Use the *term structure* of interest rate $\rightarrow$ from long to short maturity
3. Use the i*nterbank market* for reserve money $\rightarrow$ connect $i$ and $R$

## 1. Inflation expectations and the Fisher Equation
**Fisher Equation:**  $r_t=i_t-\pi_{t+1}$ 

A vaue of $r_t$ is *equivalent* to $i_t$ conditional upon knowledge of inflation expectations

We assume perfect foresight $\pi_{t+1}^e=\pi_{t+1}$ (CB has info on  $\pi_{t+1}^e$ thanks to surveys and models)

We can rewrite the **MP rule**:

The CB does not control the nominal interest rate with the same (relatively long) maturity of $r_t$. The **CB controls a series of short-term nominal interest rates**.

Need to move from long maturity rate to short maturity. The *term structure* relates interest rates with different maturities

## 2. The term structure of interest rates
