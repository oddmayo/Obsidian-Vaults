# What is macroeconomics
Study the #aggregate behaviour of economic agents
Models to explain macro phenomena
**Focus**: #long-run_growth and #business_cycles

## Growth Domestic Product - GDP
Value of all *final goods* produced in the course of a period
- It is also equal to the total *expenditure* on all final goods and services production in the economy

- Also equal to the sum of all *income* received by economic agents contributing to production

Then denote GDP by **Y** which is both total aggregate output and aggregate income:

GDP can be expressed in:
- **nominal value**: monetary units of *current year* where both prices or quantities could increase
- Volume - [real gdp]: monetary units of *reference year* which fixes prices

Note: #inflation is the percentage change of prices from one period to the next

## An idealized business cycle

**Boom**: series of positives deviations culminating in a *peak*
**Recesion**: negative deviations culminating in a *trough*

## Trend cycle decomposition
To measure business cycles break down a #time_series into a growth or *trend component* (determined by factors that influence the speed of long-run growth) and a *cyclical component* (percentage deviation of the series from its trend)

% $\rightarrow$ rates

### Irregularities in GDP fluctuations
**Regularity**: deviations from trend are persistent
**Irregularities**: amplitude and frequency of fluctuations vary consistently over time

## Macro theory
Empirical analysis of business cycles $\rightarrow$ extract regularities about historical fluctuations and crises

**goal**: causal effects $\rightarrow$ economic policies (How?) $\rightarrow$ *Models*!

## Models
Studies of the choices of free individuals immersed in complex interactions
Key $\rightarrow$ *simplicity*: abstractions that capture essential features

{actors, goods, preferences, technology, resources}

Run experiments and make *predictions* but we need two #assumptions:
1. Consumers and firms **optimize** 
2. The economy is in #equilibrium

## The AD-AS model

How do #shocks affect agents, policy makers and macro variables?

## Understanding macro events
- Business cycles: causes $\rightarrow$ policy responses
- Inflation: both high and low inflation are *problematic* $\rightarrow$ control it
- #Interest_rate:
	- Consumers: how much to borrow/lend
	- Firms: how much to invest
