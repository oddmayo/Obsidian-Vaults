# AD-AS Equilibrium and the propagation of macro shocks
## AD-AS Model

*AD mechanism*

**AS mechanism**

## AD-AS #equilibrium
![[Pasted image 20220904110637.png]]

*Aggregate demand shock* $\theta_t$ shifts the *AD curve*
**Aggregate supply shock** $y_t^n$ shifts the **AS curve**

![[Pasted image 20220904110803.png]]

### Long-run $t \rightarrow \infty$ (in which the economy will eventually return)
* *Shocks vanished* $\theta_\infty ,y_{\infty}^n$ constant  
* *optimal prices* $p_{i,\infty}=p_\infty^*$ 

Aggregate supply $y_\infty= y_\infty^n=z_\infty-\zeta\mu^*$ 
Aggregate demand $y_\infty= y_\infty^n$ (through prices)

**Equilibrium** is entirely *determined by supply*
![[Pasted image 20220904112231.png]]

In the long-run aggregate #demand $y_\infty$ is **determined entirely by** aggregate #supply

### Short-run vs Long-run
- *Short run*: prices do not fully adjust in reaction to shocks (due to *nominal #rigidities*); inflationary/deflationary pressures; *real interest rate determines aggegrate demand*
- **Long run**: prices fully adjusted so inflation is constant; equality between demand and supply determines the market clearing $r_\infty$

Now lets see the propagation of #business_cycles shocks [[Macro1 - Introduction]]

## Effect of an aggregate demand shock
Long run equilibrium at $t-1$ 
Transitory aggregate demand shock hits the economy in $t$
	$d\theta_t>0$ while $d\theta_\infty=0$ 

Understand *impact effect* on the short run equilibrium ($y_t,\pi_t$) and the *medium run dynamics* (towards the long run)

### Impact effect
![[Pasted image 20220904120408.png]]

The *magnitude* depends on the slope of the curves which can be computed from the multipliers as $K$ increases $\rightarrow \downarrow y, \uparrow \pi$

### Medium-run dynamics
![[Pasted image 20220904122935.png]]

- The fraction of optimal prices increases over time: **AS curve** rotates towards LRAS
- Reversion of $\theta_t$ (shock vanishes) triggers a gradual return of *AD curve* towards initial position
- The joint movement of AD and AS curves generate **hump-shaped dynamics** of $y$ and $\pi$ 
- Depending on the persistence of the shock it takes longer for AD to come back to its initial position (longer and more persistent rise in inflation)

## Effect of a monetary policy shock
**Expansionary** $\rightarrow$ **drop** real interest rate
*Contractionary* $\rightarrow$ *increase* real interest rate

#inflation responds very little in the short-run: '*price puzzle*'
The shock has a long lasting effect on the interest rate

## Effect of an aggregate supply shock

### Impact effect
**Mechanism:**
![[Pasted image 20220904123555.png]]

Example: positive productiviry shock $z_t \uparrow$  or a regulation shock $\mu^* \downarrow$

**Magnitude:** the impacts on $y_t$ and $\pi_t$ are larger whent the AS curve is steeper (*K large*) [shock multipliers]

*Positive shocks lowerts employment* in the short run

Empirically the data says that an increase in productivity $z_t \uparrow$ :
- *short run*: $\uparrow y$ and a transitory drop in employment
- *long run:* gradual reversion of employment towards its pre-shock level

**In the model**
In the *long run* employment is at the #natural level $l^n=\zeta \mu^*$ so if $l_t$ deviates from $l^n$ in the short run it returns to it in the long run

In the *long run* ![[Pasted image 20220904124312.png]]
The AD-AS model can **replicate short run effects of** $dz_t$:
with *nominal rigidities* ($0<w<1$) the reduction in firms real marginal costs ($w_t-p_t-z_t$) due to $dz_t>0$ is *only partially* reflected in lower prices

output is constrained by demand not increasing enough and an increase in productivity allows to serve this demans with less labor input $l_t \downarrow$

## Business fluctuations in AD-AS model
The economy so far features **two different distortions** relative to a situation in perfect competition

1. Imperfect competition: underproduction and underemployment
2. Nominal price #rigidities: $y_t \neq y_t^n$ and slows down reversions of $y_t^n$ after a shock

**Cyclycal fluctuations in** $y_t$ come from:
- fluctuations in $y_t^{cp}$ (due to AS shocks)
- fluctuations in output gap (due to AD and AS shocks under nominal rigidities)
