# Aggregate Demand
## The AD curve
Study the determinants and #fluctuations
The level depends on private sector's spending and economic policy

The real #Interest_rate  results from the *monetary policy decisions* and affects *private expenditure*

There is an interconection between private and public decisions

## The IS curve
National accounting identity

- *Private* spending components $C_t, I_t, X_t-M_t$ **descreasing** in $r_t$ 
- *Government* spending components $G_t$ which is independent of $r_t$ 
- Closed economy $X_t-M_t=0$ 
- Investments $I_t=0$ 

## The real interest rate
**Nominal #Interest_rate** $i_t$ : cost of borrowing or the return on investment in *monetary units*
**Real interest rate** $r_t$ : cost .... in *consumption goods*

The two differ because of the anticipated inflation rate

## Shocks and expectations
- #assumptions 1 (**expectations**): agents have rational expectations
![[Pasted image 20220902192256.png]]
- #assumptions 2 (**shocks**): no shocks after period $t$
ignore future shocks

*Combining* 1 and 2, agents have perfect foresight $\pi^e_{t+1}=\pi_{t+1}$

## Real interest rate and aggregate demand
![[Pasted image 20220902193644.png]]

## Aggregate demand: consumption
Private consumption results from the households **optimal choices** considering preferences and constraints
*Assumption*: marginal utility of consumption is decreasing

Households want to smmoth consumption over time $\rightarrow$ relies on **variations in savings** 
- When current *income* is *high* $\rightarrow$ *save*
- When current *income* is **low** $\rightarrow$ **debt**
---
**Households preferences and constraints**
- large number of households $j=1,...J$ 
- household seeks to maximize $u^j_t$ facing two #contraints: *budget and debt* 
The intertemportal utility gest lower over time

**Budget contraint**: consumption and savings cannot exceed the consumer resources
The sequence of budget constraints can be collapsed into the Intertemporal Budget Constraint - IBC

**Debt contraint**: ![[Pasted image 20220902194923.png]]
This constraint may not bind: reaching the desired consumption level $C^{j*}_t$ may require going into debt $A^{j*}_t<0$ , it binds and determines $C^{j}_t<C^{j*}_t$  

Summary:

*Debt: binds* $\rightarrow$ *Keynesian* household
**No debt**: **not bind** $\rightarrow$ **Ricardian** household

### Ricardian household

### Keynesian households

On the aggregate level
Aggregate consumption: #consumption levels of both Ricardian and Keynesian households depend *negatively* on the *$r_t$

### Relation with the IS-LM model
It is a generalization of standard IS-LM with *greater realism* 
- All components of private demand depend negatively on $r$ (not only $I$)
- $r_t$ governs spending decisions

## The AD curve
1. Monetary policyas given and study the determinants of aggregate demand
![[Pasted image 20220902200523.png]]

2. Endogenize the $r_t$, outcome of Central Bank's decisions

## Monetary policy and aggregate demand
How is it *determined?* Assume that the CB follows a #Monetary_Policy_Rule (MP):
![[Pasted image 20220902200714.png]]

The **MP curve** describes a monetary policy regime known as #inflation_targeting
In reality the **CB controls the nominal short term interest rate** to *influence* the **real interest rate**
