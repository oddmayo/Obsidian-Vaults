# The Liquidity Trap
## The role of the real interest rate

- If $r_t$ **too high** $\rightarrow$ $y<y^n$ (**underemployment**)
- If $r_t$ *too low* $\rightarrow$ $y>y^n$ (*excessive inflation*)

## CB's control over real interest rate
*In optimal times* the CB is able to *manipulate $r$* to reach the desired level of AD; what can go wrong?

## The #liquidity_trap
Occurs when a period of *very low interest rates* and a *high amount of cash* balances held by households and businesses **fails to stimulate aggregate demand**. Then the *CB loses control over the interest rate*

**Road map**
- *Circumstances* that may drive the economy into de liquidity trap
- Are there unconventional macroeconomic policies

## The financial crisis of 2007-2008

- Accumulation of toxic mortgages
- Reduced access to new credit
- Increase in mortgages delinquency rates $\rightarrow$ doubts about the credit worthiness of banks
- Freezing of the interbank market $\rightarrow$ lead to bankruptcy of all banks (temporary liquidity shortage)

*Can the CB do something?* $\rightarrow$ Lend the required liquidity directly to illiquid banks (**loan of last resort**)

## From financial crisis to real recession

### Channel 1: increase in credit spreads
Banks finance their lending by issuing *short term liabilities*. They were perceived as safe but panic emerged among investors in 2007

Subprime mortgages had been combined with other types of credit in complicated securities so investors lost confidence

### Channel 2: Household deleveraging
The crisis was preceded by a phase of *over accumulating of private debts* which leads to *recession* (such #deleveraging can be voluntary or forced)

**deleveraging:** a *tightening* of the debt limit $\overline{D_t}$  (a less negative $\overline{D_t}$ since $\overline{D_t}\leq0$) which *contracts aggregate demand*

Why in 2008 CBs were not able to neutralize these shocks? CBs can respond to negative demand shocks with an:

## The ZLB on the short-term nominal rate #zero_lower_bound

We assumed the CB was always able to align $r_t$ via ($r^R, R^s$)

$i^M$ is bounded below by $i^R\rightarrow$ but can the CB set $i^R$ at any value? **No**: reserve money must always compete with banknotes

*In normal times banks hold reserve money and banknotes even if $i^R>0$* because customers demand banknotes for transactions ($i^R$ cannot fall (much) below zero)
- If holding bank notes were costless $i^R\geq0$ **strict zero lower bound**
-  But since there are costs define *$\underline{i^B}$: nominal return on banknotes net of costs for holding them*
	- We have and **Effective lower bound** $\underline{i^B} \leq0$ so that $i^M\geq i^R \geq \underline{i^B}$ with $|\underline{i^B}|$ small

When $i^R < i^B$ banks prefer holding banknotes, so CB must keep $i^R \geq \underline{i^B}$ 
When the Great Recession started $i^R = \underline{i^B}$ this constrain started to *bind*

## The ZLB and the liquidity trap
Once the CB has lowered $i^R$ to $\underline{i^B}$ flooding the interbank market with additional liquidity (rising $R^s$) can only lower $i^M$ down to $i^R \simeq \underline{i^B}$ but no further

Once $i^R \simeq \underline{i^B}$ reserves and interbank loans become *almost perfect substitutes*

*Any injection of reserve money is just kept on banks accounts* $\rightarrow$ **like falling into a trap**

The ZLB may prevent the CB from lowering $r_t$ to counter a *large negative AD shock*

Within the AD-AS framework to simplify:

**The equilibrium in $t$ depends** on whether the *ZLB is binding or not*
![[Pasted image 20220904204858.png]]

If the shock is *not too large* the CB can use *conventional monetary policy*

The economy enters a **liquidity trap regime**
AD curve induces an *increasing relation* between $y_t$ and $\pi_t$ 

![[Pasted image 20220904205056.png]]

Does the #deflationary_spiral eventually stabilize? It depends: as long as the *slope of the AD curve* $>$ **slope of the AS curve**

## The fall into the liquidity trap

## The paradox of flexibility
In a liquidity trap more price flexibility *amplifies the impact of AD shokcs* on output
A lot of firms lowering the prices which *rises $r_t$* and *lowers* $y_t$

## The paradox of toil (labor supply)
In a liquidity trap the slope of the AD curve is positive $\rightarrow$ *shifts of AS curve* **lowers** both inflation and output

## The paradox of thrift (saving)
In a liquidity trap an *increase in households desired savings* **may contract** aggregate demand, output and income so much that actual saving end up falling
