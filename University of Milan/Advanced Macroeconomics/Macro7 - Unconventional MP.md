# Unconventional Monetary Policy

We need policies to affect either $\varphi$ or $\pi_{t+1}$ or both

## Forward Guidance
[[Macro6 - The Liquidity Trap]] 
In a #liquidity_trap current equlibrium ($y_t, \pi_t$) depends on future inflation via $r_t$ 
$$r_t = \varphi-\pi_{t+1}$$
Suppose the CB will recover control of $r_{t+1}$ so it can announce tht at time $t$ (during the liquidity trap) that it will seta particularly value of $r_{t+1}$ (*once out* of the trap)

This should **boost expected inflation** $\pi_{t+1}$ **and feed back to** ($y_t,\pi_t$)

**The higher future inflation the lower the real interest rate**
- FG may not be credible (krugman) since it requires the CB to deviate from inflation targeting at a time when macro conditions have gone back to normal
It may be *time inconsistent*: CB commits today to do something suboptimal tomorrow

## Large scale asset purchases (LSAP)
**Massive purchases of assets by the CB** in order to support their price and increase the liquidity (reserve money) hold by the banking system

There are two types:

### Qualitative easing
Operations are interventions on the interbank market that do not change the size of the CB's balance sheet because they are *sterilized*

- CBs *buys* some assets from private banks
- Cbs *resell* other assetst to the banking system for the same amount
But for both of these $R^s$ does not change

**CB holds riskier assets and the financial sector hold less risky assets**

### Quantittive easing
The operations are *not sterilized*

CB *buys* assets from private banks by rising the amount of $R^s$ on the account of the selling banks and just lets the size of its *balance sheet increase*

There is no substantial difference between QE operations and a standard open-market (conventional MP) operation. QE has distinguis *motivations and features* (influence $r_t$ in liquidity trap) (medium-long term impact)

#### Channels, impact and limit of QE
**Ultimate goal is to lower** $r_t$

##### Portfolio balance channel of QE
Since various assets are *imperfect substitutes* their availability affects its equilibrium price (scarcity). *If scarce* $\rightarrow$ it raises its price which *reduces* the $r_t$ $\rightarrow$ *term premium falls* $\varphi$ 

Investors rebalance their portfolio $\rightarrow$ *credit spread falls* $\zeta_t$
The fall in $\varphi+\zeta_t$ shifts the AD curve to the right $\rightarrow$ *increase* in $y$ and $\pi$ 

But its scope is limited both $\varphi$ and $\zeta_t$ are larger than zero the effect of QE **shrinks over time**

##### Signaling channel of QE
QE increases $R^s$ but at the #zero_lower_bound  and increase in $R^s$ has almost no effect on $i^M$ since $i^M-i^R \simeq0$  banks get little benefits from lending additional resources; what is the impact of $\Delta R^s$? 

An increase in $R^s$ puts a *downward pressure* on the nominal interest rate *ounce out of the liquidity trap*

QE may **signal** on accomodative policy stance in the future (raise inflation expectations to bring down $r_t$ and $y_t$ during the liquidity trap)

- QE suffers from *time inconsistenty* same as FG
- QE requires a *double commitment* on high reserves and low $r_t$

The first QE in Japan was unsuccessful as inflation expectations did not change

## Iconoclastic monetary policies
- Entirely original
- Never been implemented before
- Challenge stablished monetary dogmas

### Very negative interest rates
$i^R$ is bounded below by the nominal return on bank notes
$$i^M\geq i^R\geq \underline{i^B}$$
this is why some CBs have been able to set $i^R$ *slightly* below zero. How low can it be?

- One proposal consist in gradually phase out banknotes and ultimately *only* use *electronic money*. Lower bound $\underline{i^B}$ **would mechanically disappear**
- Other less radical proposals aim at *keeping banknotes while raising their holding costs*. This would allow CBs to **lower $\underline{i^B}$ to more negative values**

**Main limitation:** #assumption that traditional transmission channel of monetary policy is unchanged after crossing the ZLB. Recent empirical work casts *doubts about this view*: depost rate remains non-negative despite negative policy rates

### A higher inflation target

### Price-level targeting
The *target* is the *price trend*
Any shock to the level of inflation must necessarily be followed by a change in inflation of *opposite sign*

Its beneficial in the liquidity trap but constraining in normal times

*CB has to engineer an increase in inflation* as long as the price level has not returned to target
