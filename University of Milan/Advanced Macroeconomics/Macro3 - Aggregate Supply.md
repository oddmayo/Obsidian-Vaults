# Aggregate Supply
## The AS curve
Key to understand
- How do **firms** respond to *changes in the demand*
- Do they adjust prices, production scale or both
- How does firms behavior affect inflation and output

**Old Keynesian view** (IS-LM): nominal prices are constant and supply is determined by demand
**(New Classical view)**: nominal prices are perfectly flexible and demand is determined by supply

Aggregate #supply responds to changes in aggregate #demand [[Macro2 - Aggregate Demand]] but this is buffered by the *adjustment of nominal prices*

We have to follow *4 steps*

## 1. Firm behavior
Pricing decisions require imperfect #competition  (in perfect competition firms take prices as given $P = MC$), but in reality $prices > marginal.costs$ , so firms extract a #markup when setting prices.

### Monopolistic competition (imperfect competition)
*Goods are not perfect substitutes* (market power)

$\eta > 1$ measures the #elasticity of the demand for good $i$ to its price, or how *sensitive* are consumers to an increase in price of good $i$

**high** $\eta \rightarrow$ high substitutability $\rightarrow$ **low** market power (if $\eta \rightarrow \infty$ perfect competition)
assume a continuous of goods indexed by $i \in [0,1]$ aggregate demand is: $Y_t = \int_0^1Y_{i,t}d_i$

### Optimal selling price
![[Pasted image 20220904101127.png]]

When choosing the optimal selling price firms must *balance*:

**positive** impact of $P_{i,t}$ on the **markup**
*negative* impact of $P_{i,t}$ on *sales*

All firms face the *same marginal cost* $P_{i,t}=P_T^*$

### Equilibrium of real wage

## 3. Flexible price (or #natural) equilibrium
In the **natural** equilibrium all firms set $P_{i,t} = P_t^*$ in each period $t$

### Properties
1. perfectly symmetric: same $P_t, l^n, y_t^n$ 
2. imperfect competition $\mu>0$ [positive markup], $y_t^n, l^n$ are smaller than in perfeft competition
3. *output and employment* are determined by *real factors* ($z_t, \mu^*$) and are insensitive to any demand shock $\theta_t$ that does not modify the real factors
Any change in demand $y^n$ that mismatches its natural level its going to be fully *absorbed* by the flexible prices

So *demand is entirely determined by supply* and **supply is determined by real factors: technology and structure** 

## 4. Nominal price #rigidities
Nominal prices are sticky in the short run
After a macroeconomic #shocks, only some firms adjust their selling prices

- In each $t$ only a *fixed proportion $1-w$* of firm gets the chance to adjust the selling price
- Equivelently, each firm has an equal probability $1-w$ of adjusting price in each $t$ 
- The remaining fraction of firms **w** do not adjust the price and apply on *indexation rule*

## The AS curve
We have 3 equations:
![[Pasted image 20220904104511.png]]

**Properties**
- *Long run*: CB is able toa avoid hyperinflations ($t \rightarrow \infty$); inflation converges to an infinite level (constant) $y_\infty=y_\infty^n$ ; no trade-off between #inflation and output
- *Short run*: the dynamics of inflation changes reflect transitory imbalances between $l^d$ and $\zeta$; CB adjusts $r_t$ so that $y_t \rightarrow y_t^n$ 

$y_t^n$ is not observable (it's a theoretical concept) but it is sufficient to examine the inflation path to make appropiate *monetary policy decisions*: #inflation_targeting 

## The natural interest rate
![[Pasted image 20220904105259.png]]
We can define it as **the real interest rate that would prevail in the hypothetical flexible price economy**

## AS, LRAS and constant inflation curves
![[Pasted image 20220904105436.png]]

Slope of AS increases with time horizon $s$
*AS curve* is often refered to as #phillips_curve
It is not observable:
1. Approximate $y_t^n$ with an smoothed version of $y_t^n$
2. Use other observable variable linked to the output gap
