## Quick recap
- We defined rationality (axioms, preferences, utility mximization given constraints)
- Appreciate economic models
- People *sometime violate* predictions of rational models
[[Micro1 - Introduction]]

## Exponential discounting: time preferences, history, model, measurement
### Time preferences
*Trade-offs* between *costs and benefits* that occur at different points in time

For example attending school: returns to education, opportunity costs
A *rational agent* weights costs and benefits and *maximizes expected lifetime utility*

### Intertemporal choice: history of economic thought

**John Rae (1834)**: explaining differences in wealth of nations
-  The effective desire of accumulation
- A psychological factor, different across countries
- Promotion of desire of accumulation
	- **social preferences**
	- **self-control**
- Reducing desire of accumulation
	- **temptations**
	- **time preferences and risk preferences**


**Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk (1889)**: foundations for a **discount facor**; intertemporal allocation as any other **economic trade-off**

**Irving Fisher (1930)**: *Indifference curves*
- **Marginal rate of intertemporal substitution**
- **Exponential discounting model**

### Standard theory: #exponential_discounting

*Discount factor high* $\rightarrow \delta$ close to $1 \rightarrow$ *patience* (future not much discounted)
**Discount factor low** $\rightarrow \delta$ close to $0 \rightarrow$ **impatience** (future not heavily discounted)

### Assumptions of exponential discounting models
**Utility independence**: overall life-time utility matters

**Consumption independence**:
- $u(c_t)$ *independent* from past and future consumption
- No *Habit formation*
- No joy from *anticipation*

**Constant discounting** implies **time independence**
![[Pasted image 20220906181151.png]]

**Independence of discounting from consumtion**
The #dicount_factor $\delta$ is the same for all types of consumption

Samuelson (1937): Note on discount factor

$\delta$ replaces complex psychology of how people think about the future but indicates caution when interpreting

---

**Example**: get education or not?

Inmediate cost: C = -1
Discount factor:  $\delta = 0.8$
Long-term benefits?

![[Pasted image 20220906181601.png]]

How to measure $\delta$? We need data, several choices over time, and know costs and benefits associated

## Short vs long-run discounting: evidence and issues with standard model

### Thaler (1981): hypothetical monetary choices

What $x$ makes you indifferent between 15 EUR today and x EUR in: a month, a year, ten years

![[Pasted image 20220906182129.png]]

![[Pasted image 20220906182221.png]]

### Frederick, Loewenstein and O'Donoghue (2002)
*Whe have no idea what's the discount factor!* Despite being a key parameter in many economic models
![[Pasted image 20220906182401.png]]

Are discount rates constant over time?

---

### Short run impatience: evidence
- People take credit card debt
- People procrastinate
- People have unsafe sex

### Back to Thaler (1981): do we have a time-specific discount rate?

![[Pasted image 20220906182945.png]]

With an increasing delay, discount rate decreases; alternatively discount favor increases:
$\delta = \frac{1}{1+r}$

### Short vs long term discounting
- In long term relatively patience observed
- Relative short term impatience
- Constant $\delta$ seems like a reasonable assupmtion when ignoring inter-temporal decision that involve the present
![[Pasted image 20220906183448.png]]

## Present bias: time inconsistent behavior evidence, modelling present bias, implications

### Decreasing discount rates explain time-inconsistent preferences
If *discount rate* is *decreasing over time* two implications
1. **Violation of constant discount factor**
	- Give in to *temptation*
	- We indulge *short term gratification*
2. **Demand for #commitment**
	- We *regret decisions made in the past* that affect present utility 

### Present bias and time inconsistency
If we observe: $u(1) > \delta u(2)$ then it follows that $\delta^{52} u(1) > \delta^{53} u(2)$

**Dynamic consistency**: action in the future coincides with the preferred action when the time comes; no intra-personal conflicts
**State-contingent**: plans do not change over time

### Read (1999): Dynamic inconsistency in movie choice
![[Pasted image 20220906184413.png]]
**Violation** of **time independence** assumption / **Dynamic consistency**

### Demand for commitment
1. Thinking about future, patient
2. Once future arrives, succumb to our temptations

**Exponential discounting model does not capture this**

### Quasi-hyperbolic discounting
![[Pasted image 20220906184715.png]]

$0 < \beta \leq 1$ . . . short-term discount factor
we assume $\delta \simeq 1$ and $\beta<1$ 

$\beta<1$  the *lower*, *the heavier discounting* of any furute events

*Can this model explain preference reversals*? YES
![[Pasted image 20220906185206.png]]

More intuitive and with psychological foundations

**Examples**:

**Investment goods**: why we underinvest/save?
![[Pasted image 20220906185403.png]]

**Leisure (tempetation goods)**: why we succumb to them over and over
![[Pasted image 20220906185457.png]]

## Sophistication and naivite: models, implications
### Naivite vs sophistication
Are individuals aware of their self-control problems?
$\hat{\beta}$ **own belief** about own present-bias parameter $\beta$

**Naive**: $\hat{\beta} = 1$
**Sophisticated**: $\hat{\beta} \in [\beta,1)$
![[Pasted image 20220906185852.png]]

### O'Donoghue and Rabin (1999)

**Inmediate cost**
- Time consistent never regret
- Naifs regret to a full extent; large *welfare loss*
- Sophistication pays off

**Inmediate reward**
- Time consistent do the right thing
- Naifs preproperate *welfare loss*
- Sophisticates preproperate too due to *realistic pessimism*

Naifs both procrastinate and preproperate
Sophisticates preproperate
Time inconsisteny, not impatience

**Time consistent**: doesnÂ´t matter whether start at the *beginning* (naifs) or at the *end* (sophisticates)

## Self-control: model, implications
### Gul and Pessendorfer (2001)
![[Pasted image 20220906190901.png]]

**Demand for commitment**: I would have rather avoided having the tempting option on the menu:
![[Pasted image 20220906190955.png]]

*Present-biased type*: If I easily fall prey to self-control: **temptation whithout self-control**
![[Pasted image 20220906191228.png]]
*Self-control type*: I try to avoid exercising costly self-control
![[Pasted image 20220906191203.png]]

Clear **violation** of **rational decision making**
![[Pasted image 20220906191342.png]]

### Demand for commitment with dynamic consistency
- Model different from **present bias**: no **preference reversals** and **dynamic inconsistency**
- Implications for demand for commitment: here can be modelled with **dynamically consistent** preferences
- Implications for **welfare analysis**: never improves
- Cost of self-control may be individually specific

### Self-control vs dynamic inconsistency
- Both models result in **demand for commitment** (unless naive)
- Can we tell the two apart?

## Toussaert (2018): Eliciting temptation and self-control through menu choices: a lab experiment *

### Introduction

Two alternative approaches to capturing self-control problems:
1. **Present biased preferences**
2. **menu-dependent preferences**  (self-control)

**Both demmand for commitment**

**One key disctintion**: 
- Present-biased agents will choose to restrict future choice sets only if they expect to give in to temptation
- self-control types may favor commitment even if they expect to resist temptation

**Goal**: identify *control-types*
**Policy relevance**: removing temptations could be *welfare enhancing*

### Empirical challenges
It requires to know:
![[Pasted image 20220906192543.png]]

**Solution**: Lab experiment

### Generate temptations
![[Pasted image 20220906192623.png]]

### Reasons for commitment preference
![[Pasted image 20220906192805.png]]


![[Pasted image 20220906193105.png]]

### Results
![[Pasted image 20220906193152.png]]

- Although self-control types do not succumb, the model suggest that *resisting temptation involves psychic costs*: impact on productivity

### Summary
![[Pasted image 20220906193331.png]]

**Issues**: Does sophistication and self-control brek down in environments with high unvertainty?; Fairly artificial environment

## Lecture summary

- Defined the concept of #exponential_discounting
- Evidence inconsistent with a single $\delta$ parameter
- *People demand commitment* (some sophistication, sime naivite)
- quasi-hyperbolic preferences ($\beta \delta$) as one that better explains the world
- Alternative models: costly self-control
