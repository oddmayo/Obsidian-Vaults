# Uncertainty and risk preferences

## Risk preferences
Many decisions involve options with varying *amounts of risk and uncertainty*
Some choices and decisions can *reduce and mitigate risk*

### Expected utility hypothesis
**Utility function**: a math representation for how much satisfaction a good provides; but the pleasure we recieve from almost any future consumption is associated with uncertainty

### Decisions under uncertainty

Bernoulli hypothesized that the decision maker is not maximizing the expected value of money but the expectation of the utility or pleasure they recieve from the money:

Diminishing marginal utility of wealth

Demand for insurance: a risk averse consumer who is offered for insurance wll insure themselves completely. If the insurance makes profits in expectation a risk averse consumer will insure partially

## The Expected Utility Theorem
### Axioms of expected utility theory
1. Rationality
2. Continuity
3. Consequentialism (reduction of compound lotteries)
4. Independe

[[Micro1 - Introduction]]

**Rationality**:
- Completness
- Reflexivity
- Transitivity

**Continuity**: the preference relation $\succsim$ is continuous
**Consequentialism**: for all for all $L_1, L_2$ that induce the same probability distribution over $X$, we have $L1 \sim L2$

**Independence**: for all $L_1, L_2,L_3$ and $\alpha \in (0,1]$ we have

## Theorem: Von Neumann-Morgentern
The preference relation $\succsim$ fulfils the axioms iff there exists a function $u_iX \rightarrow R$ such that:

Expected Utility Theory is a normative statement but we often use it to make predictions about how people actually behave

## Violations of Expected Utility Theory
![[Pasted image 20220907133742.png]]

### Certainty effect
*Certainty effect*: relative to certain outcomes, uncertain outcomes with very large probabilities are underwighted
*Possibility effect*: relative to impossible outcomes, possible outcomes with very small probabilities are overwighted

### Reflection effect
EUT predicts symmetry when reversing gains to losses
Mirroring lottery outcomes (reflection) around zero causes a preference reversal
*DM is risk averse in the gain domain (concave) and risk seeking in the loss domain (convex)*

### Isolation effect
*Focusing* on components in which alternatives *differ* and disregarding components that the alternatives share

No absolute final wealth levels but rather changes in wealth determine the value of an alternative

**Contrast to EUT**: Utility determined only by the final outcome; alternative: **prospect theory**

Some defense of EUT: money pumps: an EUT violator can be repeatedly exploited

## Prospect theory
The decision process consists of two phases:
1. *Editing*: simplification of choice problem
2. *Evaluation*: evaluation of previously simplified choice alternatives

### Editing phase
1. Coding: reference ponint $r$
2. Combination: Lotteries simplified
3. Segregation: certain outcomes separated from uncertain
4. Cancellation: it all lottery alternatives hve the same components, these are ignored
5. Detection of dominance
6. Possibly also: simplification: rounding og possibilities

### Evaluation of lotteries
EUT anomalies suggest that
1. Reference dependence_ gains interpreted different than losses (reflection and isolation effect)
2. Probability weighting: over and underweighting probbilities (certainty and possibility effects

### Prospect Theory function

**Similar to EUT but**: outcomes compare to some reference point; probabilities not weighted with their numeric values but with their corresponding weights

### Value function
EUT considers long term perspective but changes causes emotions $\rightarrow$ *emotions and utility inseparable*

![[Pasted image 20220907165454.png]]

### Reference point
Kahneman and Tverskyfavored the *status quo* as the reference point
More recent models assume that the reference point is determined by *(rational) expectations*

### Decision weights
Decision weights $\pi_{p_i}$ of outcome $x_i$ depends on the probability p: which outcome $x_i$ realizes

### Probability weighting function
$\pi_{p_i} > \pi$ for $p$ close to $0$

## Evidence
No effect of stake size for hypothetical choices (not clear if PT valid for large stakes)
Increasing risk aversion for real choices

### Absurd implications
Risk aversion also for modest stakes
If diminishing marginal utility of wealth only reason for risk aversion

Does *PT matter in ctual markets? (Yes)*
Do customers pay for extra coverage of lower deductible?
83% of homeowners paid for a lower deductible

### EUT choices and insurance demand with deductibles
Assuming lifetime income = wealth $w$; assumit at
No isolation effect under EUT

### Results and risk aversion parameter estimates
Extreme measures of risk aversion assuming correct expectations of consumers about loss probabilities; 99.9% of the lowert deductible customers would be predicted to reject a gamble with an even chance of losing $1.000 or gaining any sum of money

**Summary:** diminishing marginal utility of wealth cannot be the explanation. Alternatives?

### Prospect theory
Isolation effect: deicision makers focus narrowly on a particular risk and evaluate the outcome compared to a reference point $\rightarrow$ total wealth $w$ disregarded

**Overweighting of small probabilities** ($\pi(p_i)$)
weighted prob. of a loss multiplied by the difference in deductible levels $\Delta P = \pi(p_i) D$ 
**loss aversion**: evaluating the outcome compared to a reference point $\rightarrow$ losses more painful than equivalent gains

The effects above explain the data

P.T can describe why people seemingly over-insure in the home insurnce market

## Lecture summary
- We defined the concept of *expected utility theory EUT*
- We discussed evidence inconsistence with EUT:
	- people ignore wealth and make decisions relative to a reference point
	- people feel losses more from equivalent gains
	- people exhibit diminishing sensitivity (risk loving in a loss domain, risk averse in a gain domain)
	- people over/under estimate small/large probabilities
- *Prospect Theory* explains all the documented phenomena
- There is *solid evidence* for P.T. in *laboratory* setting and real *markets*
