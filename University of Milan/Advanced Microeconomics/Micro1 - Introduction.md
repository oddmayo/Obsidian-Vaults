## Consumer theory

### Utility function

**Individual choice**: choose an alternative $x$ from a set $X$; *maximize* a #utility function $u$ which specifies how much $u$ per alternative $u:X\rightarrow R$ 

*Example*:
DM chooses whether to drink wine or beer
$X$ = {wine, beer}
utility function might say $u(wine)=10, u(beer)=5$

We derive $u$ from **revealed #preferences** data we can observe

**Rationality**: axioms of preferences

And two more:
- Continuity
- Non-satiation (always want more)

**Utility function features**: convexity, differentiability, diminishing marginal returns

**Indifference curves**: utility constant with varying combination of $x_1$ and $x_2$
![[Pasted image 20220906103113.png]]
*Monotonic preferences*: more of both better, less of both worse
*axioms*: exist, do not cross, #budget_constraint

### Utility maximization
A *rational agent* makes choices that mazimize their *utility* from a *set of alternatives* given their *budget contraint*

The budget constraint cannot have '$\leq$' or '$\geq$' (*not leaving ant money at the table*)

**Standard micro model**: *dual problem* $\rightarrow$ minimizing expenditures (hicksian demand)
	- *Issues*: relies on full rationality; how to deal with #uncertainty?
A model is: a simplified representation of the world (strict assumptions)

**Prototypical economist conception of human behavior**

## Behavioral economics: violations of rationality
Path forward: *non-standard preferences*
![[Pasted image 20220906105247.png]]
- #present_biased preferences: time inconsistency ($\beta, \delta$)
- *Reference dependence*: reference point
- *Social preferences*: allocation of others
- *Beliefs*: $\hat{p}(s) \neq p(s)$ 
- *Overconfidence*: wrong forecast of utility $\hat(u)$
- *Law of small numbers*: wrong forecast of p
- *Limited attention*: maximization set $\neq X_i$ 
- *Framing*
- *Persuasion*: self serving belief manipulation
- *Emotions*

## Behavioral Aurora: examples of violations, motivation

Through the standard model we can find the first order conditions and derive demand functions such that the expected utility of period 2 is solver given the optimal $t=1$ demand

### Period 2
 standard model solution for $t=2$ with saving levels: 

$max \ u(w_2,o_2)$
$(w_2, o_2)$ 

s.t. $I_2 + s \geq w_2p_w + o_2p_o$

We set up a Lagrangean, derive first order conditions and solve the demand functions for:

### Period 1
![[Pasted image 20220906113226.png]]

**Expected utility** of period 2 solved given the optimal $t=1$ demand
We derived Aurora's expected consumption at $t=1$ and $t=2$ 

Are these assumptions realistic?
- Aurora is a rtional decision maker that $max(u)$
- $u$ remains constant over time
- understands how she would feel in the future
- makes corrects projections about future income and prices
- no external conditions or choices


### Yengar and Lepper (2000): choice overload
**Experiment**: tasting booth in a supermarket
 - Randomizing choice: Limited(6) or Extensive(24) *choice of different flavors of jam*
	 - Important: limited $\subset extensive$ 

*Outcomes*: Initial attraction and subsequent purchasing behavior
*Practicality*: how to observe purchases? Individualized dscount coupons

*Results*:
Attraction:
- Extensive choice: 60%
- Limited choice: 40%

Purchases:
- Extensive choice: 3%
- Limited choice: 30%

### Aurora pays attention
*People sometimes do not take into account all options available* / make *sub-optimal decisions* given **external constraints**
- Poverty reduces cognitive capacity
- Farmers do not learn about an optimal production function despite years of experience

Is it always *irrational* not to take all options available into consideration?
*Information processing* can be understood as a **cost** that individuals want to minimize

### Aurora's tastes do not change over time

We assume $u(.)$ applies for both $t=1$ and $t=2$
*Endogenous preferences* one possibility, but studying evolution of preferences over lifetime or in response to shocks may be insightful:
- acceptance of inequality
- ethnic discrimination
- contact with people from other groups

### Aurora believes she can predict her future behavior
**Temptation** and **self-control** problems:
![[Pasted image 20220906120603.png]]

This is important for: investment over time

### Read and van Leeuwen (1998): Dynamic preference reversals

![[Pasted image 20220906120801.png]]

**Transitivity** axiom *violation*

### Aurora forms correct expectations about her future income and maximizes her expected utility
![[Pasted image 20220906120943.png]]

She may correctly learn from the past: using **Bayes rule**

She maximies her #expected_utility by weighting the probabilities

### Expected utility maximization
![[Pasted image 20220906121115.png]]

Most people choose $A \succ B$ and $D \succ C$ 

*Issue?* **Violation** of expected utility theory (rational choice)!
- People are not always expected utility maximizers
- Intuition: *reduction of compund lotteries* preference ordering should not change

---

Assume are expected utility mazimizers, but may from **Incorrect beliefs** about $q$
- *Statistical erros*
- *Confidence* (over/under)
- *Motivated beliefs*

### Aurora ares about the amount of wine / opera lessons and nothing else

But what about:
- amount of wine relative to past consumption: **reference dependence**
- wine shared with her friends vs drinking it alone: **social preferences**

---

### Rare disease problem
![[Pasted image 20220906121919.png]]

What's wrong? **Framing** to create a **reference point** (**reference dependent preferences**)
- choices involving *gains*: people are risk *averse*
- choices involving **losses**: people seem **risk loving**

Violations even when stakes involved

---

So far we assumed **'selfish' preferences**: consumption of others have no effect on our utility

Evidence:
- people share positive amounts in a dictator game
- we care what others think of us
- we obey social norms
- we value who we are
- people discriminate

relevant for:  bargaining, work contracts, institutions
