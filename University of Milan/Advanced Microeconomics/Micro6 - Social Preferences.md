# Social preferences (theory, measurements)
## Social preferences
Degree and nature of how individuals care about others: most economic analysis assumes self interest narrowly defined; caring only about one's own outcomes?

However, individuals seem to behave pro-socially in some instances

### Rationality and social preferences
Standard assumptions
- *agents selfish*: maximize utility function of their own payoff only
- *preferences outcome-oriented*: process how a given payoff was achieved does not matter
- *preferences exogenous*
Note: classical consumer theory does not prohibit social preferences

### Broader conception of human nature
What do we miss by ignoring social preferences?
Correct model of the world? Some prosociality, some selfishness

### Models of social preferences
- *Distribtional preferences*: preferences over final distributions (only final outcomes considered)
- *Intention-based preferences*: include reciprocity, procedural justice (process and intentions matter)
- *Image concerns*: people don't want to look bad in front of others and self (social intentions and behavior)

### Distributional preferences
Simplest kind of social preferences
*Interested distributional preferences*: preferenes when choices affect one's own as well as other outcomes
*Disinterested distributional preferences*: what distributions do people prefer for others?

### Self-interest vs caring about others
Major driver of behavior in many economic contexts
*possitive*: helping; *negative:* revenge, theft

## Measurement 1 Ultimatum and dictator games
Simple bargaining game extensively studied
*Two players*: proposer and responder
If accepted ($x-s,x$); if rejected ($0,0$) 

What does game theory predict?
Equilibrium offer: zero or smallest possible positive amount

Ultimatum gives more questions that answers

### Dictator game
*Dictator*: makes an allocational decision that affects herself and other subjects, the recipient
*Recipient*: passive
($x-s,s$)

**Interpretation**: *measuring raw concern for others* when you don't know anything about the other person and she hasn't done anything within the interaction
**Game theory**: dicator gives nothing
**Take-away**: in each study a significant share of individuals does not act selfishly

## Rationality and altruism
Can subjects's concerns for altruism or fairness be expressed in the economist language or a well-behaved preference ordering? *If yes preference rational*

Revealed preference axioms $U_s = U_s(\pi_1,\pi_0)$
*Preference ordering*:

**Methods**
Series of mini-dictator games manipulating cost and surplus of sharing
**Results**
very few violations of rationality

**Summary**
*Altruism is rational*; experiments can use preference-based approach

## Inequality aversion
Altruism in dictator games> if player 1 not completely selfish, they give a positive amount as long as $\beta \in [0,1)$ the share going to the player2 is never larger than 50%

*Altruism alonte cannot explain rejections in the ultimatum game*

### Fehr and Schmidt (1999): model of inequity aversion
**Core idea:** DM has disutility from unequal allocations

Utility of player 1 depends on the monetary payoff of player 2 (for  given $x_1$)

**Summary**
- *Inequity aversion model able to explain behavior in ultimatum games*
- Even a fraction of inequity averse individuals may induce selfish agents to coperate
- Model very tractable, yet still able to model actual behavior

## Reciprocity
How do models of social preferences perform under unified methodology?

### Social-welfare preferences
**Implications:** subjects always prefer more for themselves and the other person; people try to help others

*positive reprocity:* being kind in response to actual, perceived or expected kindness
*negative reprocity:* being unkind in response to actual, perceived or expected unkindness

### Summary
- Role of inequality reduction exagerated
- Reciprocity consderations are an important component of behavior
- *Implications for labor markets*

## Measurement 2 Gift exchange, trust game

## Lecture summary
- **People exhibit social preferences**, they care about payoffs of others
- **Altruistic sharing can be rationalized**
- *Altruism alone cannot explain ultimatum game rejections*: **inequality models does**, however intentions based models more consistent with other evidence: **reprocity matters**
- **Social preferences matter in actual markets**
