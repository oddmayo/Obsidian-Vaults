# Reference dependent preferences (aplications)

## Reference dependent preferences

Most important points in Prospect Theory (Kahnemand and Tversky 1979) [[Micro4 - Uncertainty]]

1. *Change rather than levels*: utility seems better described by changes in consumption rather than by levels of unsumption
2. *Loss aversion*: losses loom larger than gains
3. *Diminishing sensitivity*: people are risk averse in the gain domain, but risk loving in the loss

### Value function
Aurora has a reference-dependent utility over wine ($C_w$) and opera lessons ($C_o$)
