# Reference dependent preferences (applications)

## Reference dependent preferences

Most important points in Prospect Theory (Kahnemand and Tversky 1979) [[Micro4 - Uncertainty]]

1. *Change rather than levels*: utility seems better described by changes in consumption rather than by levels of unsumption
2. *Loss aversion*: losses loom larger than gains
3. *Diminishing sensitivity*: people are risk averse in the gain domain, but risk loving in the loss

### Value function
Aurora has a reference-dependent utility over wine ($C_w$) and opera lessons ($C_o$)

## Endowment effect
**Coase theorem**: except for transaction costs, initial entitlements do not affect final allocations
*But*: people's decisions often influenced by their current entitlements (evaluating outcomes relative to a reference point)

**Endowment effect**: once a person comes to posses a good, she inmediatly values it more than before she possesed it

Initial endowment affects preferences $\rightarrow$ affects willingness to buy or sell property rights implications for effectiveness or markets (too few tardes)

## Labor market
### Labor markets and labor supply elasticities

**Reference dependence in labor markets**: optimal stopping rule
If efforts costs convex, stop working relatively soon

**Wage elasticities**: what are wage elasticities of New York city cab drivers?

**Rational prediction**: positive correlation between $h_i$ and $w_i$, $corr(h_i,w_i)>0$
Wages correlated within days, uncorrelated across days

**Results take-away**: drivers often stop at their daily income target (negative correlation?) (loss aversion); heterogeneity: effect weaker in more experienced drivers

**Potential confounds**:
1. liquidity constraints
2. fatigue
3. unobserved shocks
**Summary**: neoclassical rational agent incompatible with the findings

Life-cycle hypothesis of labor supply questioned (but rationally seems to dominate with experience)

## Other applications
- *Asymmetric prices elasticities*: demand often responds more strongly to price increases than to price decreases
- *Pricing*: loss aversion can generate a lor of price equalization (across time and products)
- *Finance*: information aversion: people check their portfolio less in more turbulent times; disposition effect: people are more likely to hold on to stocks which have lost money and more likely to sell stocks that have made money
- *Firms*: make customers feel that they own the product

## Lecture summary
- **Loss aversion a powerful phenomenon**: losses perceived larger than equivalent gains
- **Implications for trades labor markets**, firms, finance, pricing, etc
- **Not clear what is the reference point** (how do they evolve over time?)
- Narrow bracketing and mental accounting
