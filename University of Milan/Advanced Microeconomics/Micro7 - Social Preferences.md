# Social preferences (self- and social-image)
## Quick recap
- People care about others
- People exhibit rational altrustic behavior
- People care not only about final outcomes but also about intentions

[[Micro6 - Social Preferences]]

## Image concerns
**Some puzzling observations**
- Unstable altruism
- Social and antisocial punishment
- Taboos thoughts
**Standard social preference models**
- Choices of agents with altruistic, reciproicty or fairness conerns reflect stable preferences
- A concern for positive self-image

People seem to care about how others view themselves and how they view themselves

Intrinsidc motivations social preferences
- Choosing prosocialle generates positive externality but comes at a personal cost $c$
- Agent may differ with respect to their intrinsic social preferences

**Social image**: model assumes the decision maker knows her type, but do not
**Self-image**: 
- people may self-signal one's type
- people have a vague sense of own true type
- moral decisions can be recalled to derives one's type

## Moral wiggle room
Dana, Weber and Kuand (2007): exploiting moral wiggle room: experiment demostrating an illusury preference for fairness

*Image concerns and excuses*
If people give because they do not want to appear selfish to self  (or other), they may stop doing so and act selfishly as long as they have an excuse not to give

**Summary**
- More than distributional concerns drive fair behavior even in settings involving unilateral action
- Fair  behavior may be motivated by self-impressions
- Self-image concerns may be lower with 'moral wiggle room'
- Social image concerns potentially reduced too

## Social image and statues goods

**Image concerns**: can we separate self- and social-image concerns; are self and social image affecting our behavior in economically relevant ways

### Burztyn et al (2018)
**Motivation**: negative positional externalities
suggestive evidence of social image in consumption

Why difficult to test for the link between social image and consumption casually?

**Paper summary**:
1. There is a demand for status goods
2. Status goods impose negtive positional externalities
3. Social- and self-image concerns as substitutes

**Implications**:
*Factors lowering self-steem* **may magnify** *the effects of status-seeking behavior* and susceptibility to social pressure

## Lecture summary
- *People derive utility* aslo from how they see themselves and how others see them
- Signaling models assume that we either *convince others or ourselves* about our morality
- *Image concerns are malleable*: people seem to seek for self-serving excuses
- *People engage in conspicuous consumption* and respond to negative positional externalities. The lower their self-steem, the higher demand for visible status goods. Implications for poor and marginalized
- Image concern can be tapped for good and for bad.
