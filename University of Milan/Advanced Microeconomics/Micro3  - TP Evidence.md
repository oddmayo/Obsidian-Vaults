# Time preferences evidence

## Recap
- Concept of #exponential_discounting 
- Evidence inconsistence with a single $\delta$ parameter
- People demand #commitment
- Introduced quasi-hyperbolic preferences
- Alternative models: self-control etc

Exponential discounting
- constant discounting
- dynamic inconsistency
- no demand for commitment

quasi-hyperbolic discounting (present bias)

Self-control type:
I try to avoid exercising

Present-biased type:
If I easily fall prey to self-control

## Do people realize they behave *inconsistently over time*?

### DellaVigna and Malmendier (2006): Paying to not go to the gym *

Study whether consumers behave in a time consistent fashion
Analysis of consumer contract choices from a menu
*Choice*: monthly, annual or pay-per-visit

**Rational prediction**: they choose the utility-maximizing contract

### D & M Model
- Effort costs could either be high or low ($c=c_H$ or $c=c_L$)

### Predictions vs findings
*Prediction 1*: agent chooses flat-rate contract over pay-per-visit
*Finding 1*: 80% of monthly members would benefit from pay-per-visit (**irrational**)

*Prediction 2:* high cots expected to choose monthly plan
*Finding 2:* average attendance in months 2 to 4 is 10% higher than annual (**rational**)

*Prediction 3*: average expected attendance equals average actual attendance
*Finding 3:* expected number of visits per month more than twice of the average attendance

*Prediction 4:* low attenders under the monthly contract delay cancellation for at most  few days
*Finding 4:* more than two months to cancel

*Prediction 5:* survival probability after one and two years if higher for agents who initially chose monthly membership
*Finding 5:* higher for for monthly contract

*Prediction 6:* annual contract in second year among stayers is higher than in the first year
*Finding 6:* yes

*Prediction 7:* monthly contract expected attendance should increase from month to month
*Finding 7:* it falls

### Channels?

*Consistent with standard model*: findings 2 and 6
*Inconsistent*: 1,3,4,5,7

Rule out: transaction costs, social image, projection bias, limited memory, time inconsistency with sophistication

What then?

**Time inconsistency with (partial naivete)** $\beta < \hat{\beta} \leq 1$ : *future attendance overestimation*. Not necessarily demand for commitment if $\hat{\beta} = 1$ 
**Overestimation of net benefits**: *unrealistic expectations about future attendance* and costs of switching compounded by projection bias

**Leading explanations summary**: overestimation of future self-control or future efficiency


## Do people demand commitment? Do people commit optimally?

**Commitment device**: an institution that allow a person to restrict their future choice set (by increasing costs or making them unavailable)

Time-inconsistent preferences: different selves differ

Demand for commitment requires (at least partial) sophistication

### Examples
![[Pasted image 20220907092855.png]]

### Conditions
- Person need to have a self-control problem ($\beta <1$)
- Person needs to be at least partially sophisticated
- Commitment device needs to be effective *and* needs to believe it

### Ariely and Wertenbroch (2002): procrastination, deadlines, and performance: self-control by precommitment

![[Pasted image 20220907093205.png]]

*Result 1*: people self-impose constly deadlines to overcome procrastination
*Result 2*: deadline-setting improves performance
- performance greater for self-imposed deadlines
- present bias
- partial sophistication
*Result 3*: deadline-setting is sub-optimal

## For which settings in this economically relevant?

**Agriculture example**: farmers would like to purchase fertilizer, but they run out of money by the time the new season comes.

**Commitment saving products in the Phiippines**: Do individuals open a savings account with a commitment feature that restricts their access to their funds but has no further benefits?
- *Treatment*: half of sample offered a savings account 'SEED'
- Characteristics of interest: preference reversals in time preference questions; imaptience
- *Preference reversals*: impatient now and patient later; other way too

### Results
- **Take-up SEED and hyperbolic discounting**: women hit hyperbolic preferences more likely to take of SEED. results for men in the same directions: insignificant
- **Intent-to-treat (ITT)**: effect the average effect of simply being offered the commitment product

### Implications
- Development for best saving practices for policy-makers and financial situations
- **Results consistent with:**
	- Quasi-hyperbolic preferences
	- Temptation model
- **Welfare implications**: ambiguous
	- loss of liquidity may cause harm

## Can commitment harm?

### John (2020): When commitment fails
![[Pasted image 20220907101724.png]]

Demand for commitment by type
- *Sophisticated* hyperbolic discounters
- Partially sophisticated hyperbolic
- *Naives* (no demand for commitment)

### Summary
- Implications possibily for pension saving plans, diet clubs and gym contracts
- **Solution?** Hard to say

### Kaur, Kremer, Mullainathan (2015): Self-control at work
Means that workers often do not work as hard as they themselves would like
Worker self-control problems hurt employer hurts directly

Learning indicates naivite can be partially corrected

**Implications**: possible explanation for huge sucess of industrial revolution: rule of factory discipline; heterogeneity suggets that control / dominated contracts only help a sub-group of population: potentially harmng welfare of others

## Do people understand their own time inconsistency? Or that of others?
Fedyk (2021): Assymetric Naivite: belief about self-control

People aware of present bias $\rightarrow$ good at precicting others' present bias
But individuals *overconfident* about own present bias (*bias blind spots*)

## Do people learn overtime with feedback?

Le Yaouanq and Schwardman (2019): learning about one's self

How can naivite about present bias persist despite experience?
*Unpleasant real effort task*

Participants get less naive over time $\rightarrow$ learning
Persistent naivite unlikely due to inability to learn

People do not expect to learn: anticipated learning 8 times smaller than actual learning

Possible remaining explanations for persistence of naivite:
- *missattribution of failures*
- *Imperfect or biased recall*
