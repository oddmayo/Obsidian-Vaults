# Time preferences evidence

## Recap
- Concept of #exponential_discounting 
- Evidence inconsistence with a single $\delta$ parameter
- People demand #commitment
- Introduced quasi-hyperbolic preferences
- Alternative models: self-control etc

Exponential discounting
- constant discounting
- dynamic inconsistency
- no demand for commitment

quasi-hyperbolic discounting (present bias)

Self-control type:
I try to avoid exercising

Present-biased type:
If I easily fall prey to self-control

## Do people realize they behave *inconsistently over time*?

### DellaVigna and Malmendier (2006): Paying to not go to the gym

Study whether consumers behave in a time consistent fashion
Analysis of consumer contract choices from a menu
*Choice*: montlhy, annual or pay-per-visit

**Rational prediction**: they choose the utility-mazimizing contract

### D & M Model
- Effort costs could either be high or low ($c=c_H$ or $c=c_L$)
