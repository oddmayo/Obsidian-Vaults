# Chapter 6 - Project Team Building, Conflict and Negotiation

## Introduction

Team building and conflict management are two of the most difficult undertakings.

## Building the project team

First, an **assessment of skills, then of availability and finally opening communication with likely candidates**. But some issues arise: who should choose the person to be assigned to the project, how long are the team member's services required? Among others.

In the event of unfruitful negotiations the PM can try to negotiate for partial assistance, adjust project schedules and priorities accordingly.

## Characteristics of effective project teams

- Clear sense of mission
- Understanding of team interdependencies
- Cohesiveness
- High level o trust
- Shared sense of enthusiasm
- Result oriented

A clearly **understood project mission** is the number one predictor of success as the project is being developed.

**Interdependency** refers to the degree of joint activity among team members that is required in order to complete a project.

**Cohesiveness** refers to the degree of mutual attraction that team members hold for one another and their task.

**Trust** can be understood as the team's comfort level with each individual member. Is dependent on past history and can occur on several levels, and can occur on several levels.

**Enthusiasm** is the key to creating energy and spirit that drives effective project efforts.

**Result orientation** suggests that each member of the project team is committed to achieving the project's goals.

## Reasons why teams fail

- Poorly developed or unclear goals
- Poorly defined project team roles
- Lack of project team motivation
- Poor communication
- Poor leadership
- Dysfunctional behavior

## Stages in group development

1. Forming

**Mold** a collection of individuals into a coherent project team.

2. Storming

**Natural reactions** members have to the initial ground rules.

3. Norming

Unwritten rule of behavior **mutually agreed-upon** practices and attitudes

4. Performing

The **actual work** of the project team is done.

5. Adjourning

Projects and their teams **do not last forever**.

*Punctuated equilibrium* proposes that rather than evolution occurring as a steady state of gradual change, real natural change comes about through long periods of stasis, interrupted by some cataclysmic event that propels upward, evolutionary equilibrium.

## Conflict management

It begins when you perceive that **someone has frustrated or is about to frustrate a major concern of yours**. Conflict is not a state, but a process that evolves, and perceptual in nature.

Goal-oriented conflict is associated with disagreements regarding results, project scope, outcomes, performance and objectives. Interpersonal conflict occurs with personality differences. There are three schools of thought about how conflicts should be perceived and addressed: *Traditional view, behavioral and interactionist*

Some of the most common causes of organizational conflict are:

- reward systems 
- scarce resources 
- uncertainty 
- differentiation

The PM may employ either diffusion or confrontation tactics in negotiating a solution. The key is **flexibility**, to be less concerned with the source of conflict than with a mutually acceptable solution. Conflict is often evidence of *team progress*.

## Negotiation

Manager's ability to use his influence productively. Three questions: How much power do I have? What sort of time pressures are there? Do I trust my opponent?

The *more* we can focus on the *issues* that separate us and pay *less* attention to the *people* behind the issues, the **greater the likelihood of achieving a positive negotiated outcome**

Don't blame them for your problems.

Focus on interests, not positions, as **interests define the problem**

A common negotiating approach is to sometimes table the larger items to later point in the negotiation, *focusing instead on minor or peripheral issues* that offer greater likelihood of reaching agreement.
