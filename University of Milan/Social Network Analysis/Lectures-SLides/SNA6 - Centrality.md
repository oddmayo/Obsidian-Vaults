# Centrality

Three artificial graphs that highlight the differences among centrality measures
![[Pasted image 20221020080955.png]]

One node in the star completely outranks the others, while the other themselves are interchangeable

All nodes in the circle are interchangeable

In the line graph centrality decreases from that for $n_1$, to $n_2$ and $n_3$ and so on up to $n_6$ and $n_7$
## Degree centrality

### Degree centrality in undirected networks

The degree centrality ranks nodes with more connections higher in terms of centrality

$$C_d(v_i)=d_i$$

$d_i$ is the degree (number of adjacent edges) for vertex $v_i$

In this graph degree centrality for vertex  $v_1$ is $d_1=8$ and for all others is $d_j=1$, $j\neq1$

In the previous image...

Star: $C_d(1)=6, C_d(other nodes)=1$
Circle: $C_d(all nodes)=2$
Line: $C_2(1)=2, C_b(2,3)=2, C_b(4,5)=2, C_b(6,7)=1$

### Normalized degree centrality

Does not allow for centrality values to be compared across networks

- Normalized by the maximum

### Degree centrality in directed graphs






## Betweenness centrality




## Closeness centrality
