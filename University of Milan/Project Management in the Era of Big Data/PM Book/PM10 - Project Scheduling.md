# Chapter 10 - Project Scheduling: Lagging, Crashing and Activity Networks

## GANTT Charts

Establish a *time-phased network* which links projects activities to a project schedule baseline.

Gantt charts offer an important advantage over PERT diagrams, the link activities to a project schedule baseline base on *actual calendar dates*.

Advantages:
1. Easy to learn and *comprehend*
2. Identify the project network coupled with its scheduled baseline
3. Allow got updating and *project control*
4. Useful for identifying *resource needs* and assigning *resource tasks*
5. *Easy to create*

## Project Schedule Alternatives

1. Adding resources to the project team
2. Fast-tracking
3. Compromising quality
4. Reducing the project's scope
5. Using overtime

## Trade-offs to Crash Project Activities

When it has been determined that the project must be accelerated due to:
- External environment
- Pressures from top management or customers

A method called **project crashing** is employed: crashing directly links all activities to their respective costs and allow us to *calculate the costs for each day we choose to accelerate the project*.

## Controversies

Some implications in using activity networks in the project:
 1. Networks can become *too large and complex*
 2. *Oversimplification* or incorrect representation
 3. Sometimes used for *tasks for which not well suited*
 4. Networks used to *control behavior* have special *dangers*
 5. Strong potential for *positive bias in PERT estimators*
