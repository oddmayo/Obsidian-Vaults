# Chapter 2 - The Organizational Context

## Introduction

How project management may be best employed, regardless of the structure the company has adopted.

## Projects and organizational strategy

**Strategic management** is the science of formulating, implementing and evaluating cross-functional decisions (*strategic plans*).

Strategic vision $\rightarrow$ driving force of project development

An organization's **strategic management** is the first *important contextual element* of its project management approaches.

## Stakeholder management

All individuals or groups who have an *active stake in the project* and can potentially impact its development. Consist in formulating strategies to identify and, if necessary, **manage for positive results** the impact of stakeholders in the project.

For example: top management, accountant, project team members and externals such as competitors, suppliers or other intervenor groups.

*Supply chain management*: project manager must stay on top of the cost of the project, an *efficient cost control and reporting mechanism* is vital.

*Block* offers a useful framework:
1. Assessing the environment
2. Identify the goals of the principal actors
3. Assess your own capabilities
4. Define the problem
5. Develop solutions
6. Test and refine the solutions

Project teams must look for hidden agendas in goal assessment.

## Organizational structure

A span of control determines the number of subordinates directly reporting to each supervisor.

## Organizational #culture

Own outlook, operating policies and procedures, patterns of thinking, attitudes and norms of behavior.

**Collective or shared learning** of a group, and it influences how that group is likely to respond in different situations. An organization may contain a number of different cultures, operating in different locations or at different levels.

Among the *key factors that affect the development of a culture* are:
- Technology
- Environment
- Geographical location
- Reward systems
- Rules and procedures
- Key organizational members
- Critical incidents: public expression of what rules really operate

Culture can affect in four ways: departmental interaction, employee commitment to goals, planning and performance.

Escalation of commitment occurs when, in spite of evidence identifying a project as failing, organizations continue to support it past its life cycle.

**Summary**: the critical contextual factors are the organization's strategy, structure and culture.
