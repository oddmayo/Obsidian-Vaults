# Chapter 7 - Risk Management

## Project risk

Any possible **event** that **negatively affect** the viability of a project.

**Risk event**: probability of event $X$ consequences of event

**Effective risk management**: needs to be done *early* in the project's life

**Impact risk factor**: the product of the likelihood of the *event's occurrence* and the *adverse consequences* that would result.

**Stage with highest risk**: the number of unknowns in the early stage of a project, is the stage where the risk is the highest.

**Addressing risk**: as the project moves forward, the team continues to address risk with technical, administrative and budgetary strategies.

## Distinct phases of project risk management

1. *Risk identification*: determine a realistic set of risk factors a project faces.
2. *Analysis of probability and consequences*: focus on response of various risk factors by determining the impact factor of each one.
3. *Risk mitigation strategies*: steps taken to minimize the potential impact of those risk factors.
4. *Control and documentation*: creating a knowledge base for future project based on lessons learned.

## Causes of risk
 - Financial
 - Technical
 - Commercial
 - Execution
 - Contractual/legal

## Methods for risk mitigation

1. Brainstorm meetings
2. Expert opinion
3. Past history
4. Multiple or team-based assessments

Recognize four risk mitigation strategies:

- Accept the risk: when there is no other alternative
- Seek to minimize risk: partnerships or joint ventures
- Sharing risk
- Transferring risk
