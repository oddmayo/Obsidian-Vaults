# Chapter 4 - Leadership and the Project Manager

## Introduction
**Leadership** is the ability to inspire confidence and support among the people who are needed to achieve organizational goals.

For the *project manager* is the process by which he or she influences the project team to get the job done. It is one of the **most important** characteristics in successful project management.

## Leaders vs managers

Successful **team leaders** are often those who were best able to create the **partnership** attitude between themselves and their teams.  Four things are necessary to promote partnership:
- Exchange of purpose
- A right to say no
- Accountability
- Absolute honesty

*Successful project managers are successful project leaders*

## How the project manager leads

*Project resources* refer to all personnel and material resources necessary to accomplish objectives. The lack of resource support can occur for several reasons, including:
- Project goals deliberately vague
- Project lacks a top manager sponsor
- Project requirements were deliberately understated
- Not enough money
- Distrust

The **key point** is that *recognizing and responding to resource needs is a critical function of project leadership*.

Another common tactic is to rely on negotiations or political tactics to influence top management to provide additional support.

*Motivation* ultimately comes from within each of us, it cannot be stimulated solely by an external presence. PM should be able to keep an eye on the big picture and deal with small problems.

PM must recognize the importance of **communication** and become adept at it.

*Meetings*: define the project and major team players, provide an opportunity to revise all participant's knowledge base, assist team members in understanding how their individual efforts fit into the overall whole of the project, and help stakeholders increase their commitment.

**Leadership behavior**:
1. Task oriented: get the job done
2. Group maintenance: supportive activities, including showing confidence and trust

Both of these allow the PM to **gain the maximum benefit from meetings**
