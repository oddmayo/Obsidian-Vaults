# Chapter 3 - Project Selection and Portfolio Management

## Introduction

A project **portfolio** is a set of projects that an organization is undertaking at any given time. With multiple projects, the challenges are magnified.

## Project selection

The need for a priority system or selection models to save time and money while maximizing the likelihood of success. <u>Souder</u> identifies five issues to consider:
1. Realism
2. Capability
3. Flexibility
4. Ease of use
5. Cost

These models come in *two general classes*: numeric and nonnumeric.
- Numeric: use numbers as inputs.
- Nonnumeric: rely on other data.

Need to consider risk and commercial factors, internal operating issue, among others. The most complete model in the world is still only a **partial reflection of organizational reality**. Embedded in every decision model are both objective and subjective factors.

## Approaches to project screening and selection

Valuable tool in helping an organization make optimal choices among numerous alternatives.

1. The simplest method of project screening is developing a **checklist** and then applying them to different possible projects, taking into account cost of development, return on investment, government interference, etc. 

	A check list approach *may be best used in consensus-group setting*, but these fail to resolve trade-off issues.

2. In the **simplified scoring model**, each criterion is ranked according to its relative importance. This model is easy to use and comprehend.

	This model is an abbreviated and unsophisticated version of the *weighted-scoring approach*, since its ease of use may blind novice users to the sometimes false assumptions that underlie them. Also, these models don't ensure that there is a reasonable link between the selected and weighted criteria and the business objectives.

3. **Profile models** allow managers to *plot risk/return options* for various alternatives and then select the project that maximizes return while staying within a certain range of minimum acceptable risk. 

	They offer an alternative but limit decision criteria.

## Financial models

**Time value of money principle**: money earned today is worth more than money we expect to earn in the future; because of:
- Inflation
- Inability to invest money

**Payback period**: amount of time what will be necessary to recoup the investment in a project. The goal of *discounted cash flow (DCF)* method is to estimate cash outlays and expected cash inflows resulting from investment in a project.

The *weighted cost of capital* is the percentage of capital derived from either debt or equity ($wd$, $we$), times the percentage costs of debt and equity ($kd$, $ke$).

$Kfirm = wd*kd(1-t) + we*ke$

The **Net present value (NPV)** method projects the change in the firm's value if a project is undertaken. Its principal *advantage* is that it allows firms to link project alternatives to financial performance, but among the *disadvantages* is the difficulty in using it to make accurate long-term predictions.

Under the **discounted payback method** the time period we are interested in, is the length of time until the sum of the discounted cash flow is equal to the initial investment. The *advantage* is the that it allow us to make a more 'intelligent' determination of the length of time needed to satisfy the initial project investment. It's more representative of financial realities.

**Internal rate of return (IRR)** is an alternative method for evaluating the expected outlays and income associated with a new project investment opportunity. *Advantage*: allow to compare alternative models; projects having higher IRR are generally superior to those having lower IRR. The *disadvantage* is that is less robust than NPV for example, as it may arrive to multiple solutions.
