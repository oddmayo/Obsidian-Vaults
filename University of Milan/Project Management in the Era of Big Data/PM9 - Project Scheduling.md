# Chapter 9 - Project Scheduling: Networks, Duration Estimation and Critical Path



## Key Scheduling Terminology
1. How *activity networks* are constructed
2. *Task durations* are estimated
3. The *critical path* and activity float are calculated
4. Lag relationship are built into activities

**Create activity networks**: creation of project tasks $\rightarrow$ use of WBS [[PM5 - Scope Management]]

Apply logic to identify predecessors and successors

**Creating and AON (activity-on-node) network**
- Identification of predecessor
- Link activities together
- Activity-On-Node $\rightarrow$ design all tasks as specific *nodes and link them* with arrows

**Nodes**: representing project activities in a label

## Activity Duration

Identifying the various tasks in a project and then applying a method for estimating the duration of each of these activities. Methods that aid:
- *Noncomputational* techniques
- Deriving duration estimates through computational *math analysis*
- Program Evaluation and Review Technique (*PERT*)

---

## Critical Path

**Forward pass**: network calculations that determine the *earliest start/earliest finish time for each activity* by working forward through each activity in the network.
- Using decision rules
- Adding early start plus activities duration to determine early finish
- Apply this early finish value to the next node in the network
- Use decision rules for the backward pass to identify all activities and paths with float and the project's critical path

**Backward pass**: a subtractive process that gives us information on when the *latest activities can begin and end*

## Activity Float

**Network linking project activities**: it is possible to begin determining the estimated duration of each activity.

**Duration estimation**: performed using *probabilistic estimates* based on PERT.

**Activity duration network**: identify the individual paths through the network, lengths and critical path.

**Project's critical path**: is defined as the activities of a project which, when linked, define its *shortest total length*. It defines *how quickly we can complete the project*.
