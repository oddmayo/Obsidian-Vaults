# Chapter 14 - Project Closeout and Termination

**Project termination** consist of all activities consistent with closing out the project with two alternatives:
- *natural* termination
- *unnatural* termination

## Types of Project Termination

1. Termination by **extinction**: stopped due to successful or unsuccessful conclusion-
2. Termination by **addition**: concludes a project by institutionalizing it as a formal part of the parent organization.
3. Termination by **integration**: common but exceedingly complicated method for dealing with successful projects. Reintegrated within the organization's existing structure following the conclusion of the project.
4. Termination by **starvation**: political reasons, budget cuts. A form of *neglect*.

## Natural Termination

Some activities are necessary to close out projects.

**Finishing the work**: as a project moves toward its conclusion, several tasks still need to be c*ompleted or polished*. Important not to lose focus and maintain motivation.

**Handing over the project**: transferring the project could be straightforward or a highly complex process.

**Gaining acceptance for the project**: client acceptance as just transferring it is not enough.

**Harvesting the benefits**: first develop an effective and meaningful measurement system that identifies the goals, time frame, and responsibilities involved in project use and value assessment.

**Reviewing how it all went**: objectivity, internal consistency, replicability and fairness.

Even with in depth *lessons learned* analysis several errors can occur at this stage: misidentifying systematic errors, misapplying appropriate lessons and failing to pass along lessons learned conclusions.

Instead follow three important guidelines:
1. Establish clear rules of behavior for all parties to the meeting
2. Describe as objectively as possible what occurred
3. Fix the problem, nor the blame

**Putting it all to bed**
- Documentation
- Legal
- Cost
- Personnel

**Disbanding the team**: the formality of the disbanding process depends to a great deal degree on the size of the project.

**What prevents effective project closeouts**: getting the project signed off discourages other closeout activities; the assumed urgency of all projects pressures us to take shortcuts on the back end; closeout activities are given a low priority and are easily ignored.

## Early Termination of Projects

**Making the early termination decision**:
1. When costs exceed business benefits
2. When the project no longer meets strategic fit criteria
3. When deadlines continue to be missed
4. When the technology evolves beyond the project's scope


**Shutting down the project**: Emotional issues of the project team; emotional issues of clients; intellectual issues - Internal and External.
- detailed audit of all project deliverables
- closure of work packages
- disposal of unused equipment or materials

**Allowing for claims and disputes**: legal issues
1. Ex-gratia claims: when there is no contractual basis for the claim (moral obligation)
2. Default claims by the project company in its obligations under the contract

When disputes are encountered they are typically handled through legal recourse, often in the form of **arbitration**: formalized system for dealing with grievances and administering corrective justice to parties in a bargaining situation (*fair settlement or resolution*).
