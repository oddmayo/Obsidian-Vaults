# Chapter 1 - Introduction: Why Project Management

## Introduction
**Projects** are one of the principal means by which we change our world. Project management has become a critical component of successful business operations in worldwide operations.

## What is a project
A **process** refers to ongoing, *day-to-day activities* in which an organization engages while producing goods or services. Processes use existing systems, properties, and capabilities in a continuous, repetitive manner. **Projects**, on the other hand, *take place outside the normal, process-oriented world of the firm*.

A project has a beginning and an end to meet goals within parameters of *cost, schedule and quality*. They are goal oriented, of finite duration and unique.

- Objective with specifications
- Start and end dates (life cycle)
- Funding limits
- Consume human and nonhuman resources
- Multifunctional
- Costumer focused

In the **PMBok** guide, a project is defined as "a temporary endeavor undertaken to **create a unique product or service**".

The traditional management functions of planning, organizing, motivation, directing and control apply to project management.

The **principal outcome** of a project are the *satisfaction of customer requirements*.

**Process orientation** is the need to *perform work as efficiently as possible*.

## Why are projects important?
- David Cleland: the pressures that organizations find themselves facing
- *Shortened product life cycles*
- Narrow product launch windows
- Emergence of global markets

## Project life cycles

Stages in a project's development:
- **Conceptualization**: development of the initial goal
- **Planning**: specifications and schedules
- **Execution**: actual work of the project
- **Termination**: completed project transferred to the customer

These stages are the *waypoints* at which the project team can evaluate both its *performance* and *overall status*. Five components can change over the course of its life cycle: client interest, project stake, resources, creativity and uncertainty.

## Determinants of project success

Four criteria of project success:
- Time
- Cost
- Performance
- Client acceptance
