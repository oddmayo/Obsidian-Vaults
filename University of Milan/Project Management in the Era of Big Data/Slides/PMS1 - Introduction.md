## Big Data definition and history

**Big data** is a term that describes *large, hard-to-manage* volumes of data - both structured and unstructured. It is also important **what organizations do with data**.

Big data can be analyzed for insights that *improve decisions* and *give confidence*.

Early 2000s the **Three V's**:
- **Volume**: data lakes, Hadoop and the cloud
- **Velocity**: Internet of things, data streams
- **Variety**: all types of formats

But also two *additional dimensions*:

- **Variability**: data flows are unpredictable (trends and peaks)
- **Veracity**: quality of data (different sources); need of data linkages

All these V's lead to **Value**: costs and insights

## Why is Big data important

The value lies in **how you use data** to:
- improve operational efficiencies
- optimize product development
- drive new revenue
- enable smart decision making

Combining big data with **high-performance analytics** you can accomplish:
- determining root causes of failures
- spotting anomalies faster
- improving patient outcomes
- recalculating entire portfolios

## Top big data analytics use cases (Oracle)

It can benefit **every industry** and **every organization**:
- Manufacturing
- Healthcare: genomic research (genes and biomarkers)
- Telecommunications
- Retail
- Oil and gas
- Financial services: capturing new market opportunities to reducing fraud

Some **challenge**: long processing times, disperse data, integrations.

*Data silos* can be one of the main causes of **inefficiency and cost**: isolation of data.
