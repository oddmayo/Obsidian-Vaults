## 1. **Conception & initiation**

The goal is to **define the project**: starts with the business case or project charter (reasons, objectives, stakeholders, benefits, budget):
- organization
- implementation plan
- potential problem areas: risks

Tips: **brainstorming** and **keep it short**: context, objectives, team, scope, activities.

Create the Project Initiation Document (PID): purpose and requirements



## 2. **Definition and planning**


Developing a **roadmap** for the team to follow, S.M.A.R.T. method:

- Specific: who what, where...
- Measurable: criteria
- Attainable: most important goals
- Realistic
- Timely: timeframe

Some documents the PM will create during this phase:
- **Scope statement**: business need 
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: sections
- **Milestones**: high-level goals
- **Gantt chart**: visual timeline
- **Communication plan**: proper messaging
- **Risk management plan**: identify all foreseeable risks



## **3. Project execution**

The team develops and **completes deliverables**, begins with the kickoff meeting:

**Kickoff meeting**: first meeting to set *common goals*
- Introductions
- Statement of work
- Tracking progress
- Tools and methods

Develop team, assign resources, plans, tracking systems, tatus meetings, among others.


## **4. Performance and monitoring**

Ensures that project **results align with the management plan**. Here PM use **KPIs** to determine if the project is on track.

Most common KPIs:
- Project objectives: on schedule
- Quality deliverables: specific task being met




## **5. Project close**

Once completed **formally close it**. Post mortem meeting to *evaluate successes and failures*. 

Perform a **final project budget** and prepare a **final project report**

It is important to close the project to avoid:
- repeating mistakes in the future
- creating liability issues
- unmaintained deliverables

By officially closing a project you minimize risks, increase *satisfaction* and ensure all parties are in the same page.


**Closeout checklist**: evaluate business outcomes
1. Confirm work is done
2. Complete procurement closure
3. Gain formal acceptance
4. Complete final performance reporting
5. Index and archive records
6. Update lessons learned
7. Hand-off completed product
8. Release the resources
