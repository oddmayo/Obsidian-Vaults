# Chapter 5 - Scope Management

## Introduction

A **project scope** is everything about a project - *work content* as well as *expected outcomes*.

It is the function of **controlling** the project in terms of goals and objectives, It provides the **foundation** upon which all project work is based. It seeks what needs to be done by whom and by what date.

The six main activities:

1. Conceptual development
2. The scope statement
3. Work authorization
4. Scope reporting
5. Control systems
6. Project closeout

The **goal** is *maximum efficiency* through the formation and execution of plans or 
systems that leave as little as possible to chance.

## Conceptual development

Addresses project objectives by finding the best ways to meet them. Key steps in information development:
- Problem statement
- Information gathering
- Constraints
- Alternative analysis
- Project objectives

Begins with the process of **reducing the project's overall complexity**: create a reasonable and complete problem statement, and a set of concrete goals.

## The Statement of Work (SOW): 

A detailed **narrative description of the work required** for a project. Some elements:
- Introduction and background
- Technical description of the project
- Timeline and milestones a SOW can obtain the following components:
	- Background
	- Task 1
	- Objective
	- Approach
	- Input source

It serves as the *summary of the conceptual development* phase of the project plan. It also reflects a project team's best efforts at creating the documentation and approval of all project parameters prior to the development phase.

According to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBoK), a *Work Break Down Structure (WBS)* is a deliverable-oriented grouping of project elements which organizes and defines the total scope of the project.

An additional benefit of the *WBS* is the ability to organize the work needed to be performed into cost control accounts. It allows for better initial linking of project activities and their budgets.

To identify team personnel who will be directly responsible for each task in the project's development, a *Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM)* is developed.

## Work authorization

Is a step that reflects the formal 'go ahead' given to the project to commence contractual documents. The key point is grounded in the nature of **stated terms** for project development.

## Scope reporting

Determines the **types of information that will be regularly reported**, who will receive copies and how will be acquired and disseminated.

## Control systems

Are vital to *ensure that any changes to the project baseline are conducted in a systematic and thorough manner*. A baseline is defined as the project's scope fixed at a specific point in time: **configuration**.

Configuration management works towards formalizing the change process as much as possible as early in the project's life as possible.

## Project closeout

Appropriate planning for a project's termination. One of the most important lessons for successful PMs is to **start with the end in mind**.
