# Chapter 13 - Project Evaluation and Control

## Control Cycle

1. Setting goals
2. Measuring progress
3. Comparing actual progress with plans
4. Correcting significant deviations

## Properties

**Projects definitions & goal**: projects are defined as temporary endeavors undertaken to create a unique product of service.

**Project properties**:
- Complex, one-time processes
- Limited by budget, schedule and resources
- Developed to resolve a clear goal or set of goals
- Customer focused
- Operate outside of normal organizational processes

## Strengths and Weaknesses

**Project S-curves**: seek to reconcile the project schedule baseline with *planned budget expenditures*.

**Cumulative project budget**: creates a schedule/budget relationship that early project monitoring methods found useful as an indicator of *expected progress*.

**S-curve drawbacks**: 
- Do not allow us to make reasonable interpretations as to the cause of variance
- It might lead us into making inaccurate assumptions about project performance

**The tracking Gantt chart**: constantly update the project's status by linking task completion to the schedule baseline.
- *key benefit*: easy to understand and updated quickly
- *drawback*: do not identify the underlying source of problems and do not allow for future projections of the project's status

## Earned Value Management (EVM)
It is necessary to jointly consider the **impact** of *time, cost and project performance* on any analysis of current project status. It allows the team to make future projections of project status based on its current state.

It **links** all three primary project success metrics


- **Planed value**: authorized budget
- **Earned value**: measure of the work performed expressed in terms of budget
- **Actual cost of work performed**: realized cost for the work performed
- **Schedule variance**: schedule performance expresses as $EV - PV$


The first step in developing an accurate control process is to create the project baselines against which progress can be measured. It requires the **WBS** and the **time-phased project budget [[PM5 - Scope Management]]

Earned value can be employed to **measure trends in project performance**.


## Using EVM a Portfolio of Projects

Aggregation of all earned value measures across the firm's entire project portfolio.

**Flow of earned value system**:
- *Proposal stage*: specifics of the program
- *Contract award*: all critical elements and requirements of the project are defined
- *Baseline stage*: detailed planning, project schedule and formal work authorization is developed
- *Maintenance phase*: monitoring and control stage

## Issues in the Effective Use of EVM

1. **0/100 rule**: assigned value of zero until the activity is finished and switches to 100.
2. **50/50**: when started, receives 50%
3. **Percentage complete rule**: agree on completion milestones.

Use too much detail and is more likely to mislead than to clarify the true status of a project.

## Human factors in Project Evaluation and Control

There is a strong incentive in most organizations for project team members to continuously report stronger results than may be warranted in the interested of **looking good for the boss**.
