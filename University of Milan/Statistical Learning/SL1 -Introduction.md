o Tidyverse and Tidymodels
o Stacks, H2O, Keras
o DALEX & LIME

**Exam**: the exam consists in two assignments, one on the first part (**supervised learning**) and the second part (**unsupervised learning**). For both you must prepare a writing report using one or more techniques and comparing their performance on one or more data set chosen by the student. A brief oral presentation of the reports will be asked.

Each report must contain:
	• short abstract: what are your going to present in the report
	• statement of the problem/goal of the analysis and description of the data set(s)
	• list of three to five findings/keypoints
	• the analysis with wise commentary
	• (optional) theoretical background of the used methods
	• conclusions (should include the findings/keypoints)
	• the Appendix (optional), containing all the R code

• The **paper length is irrelevant** provided that the content is correct.
• **No R code in the main text**. The R code must be confined to the **appendix**
• The report should be prepared in PDF only

The (PDF) report should be sent, with the R code and the dataset (link of file), to silvia.salini@unimi.it 5 days before the scheduled exam.
