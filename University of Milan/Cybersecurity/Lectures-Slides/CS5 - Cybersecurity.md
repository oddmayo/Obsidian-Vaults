## Cybersecurity
Use social engineering (human weakness) to attack the system

## What is cybersecurity
It is a **branch of computer science**
It is a **public good**: to protect the population
It is a **competitiveness factor**: stakeholders more inclined to invest in companies with a strong record of cybersecurity
It is an element of **corporate responsibility**: as a way to protect your business

## The 'mantras' of cybersecurity
- Cybersecurity is not a product, but **a asymptotic process**: it is a continuous process of learning
- The most important thing is to educate the human factor, since human links are weaker than technical ones
- **Total security is impossible**. We are vulnerable by definition
- Sun Tzu quote
- The KISS rule is the best way to design a policy (Keep It Simple and Stupid)
- Being too much confident s more dangerous than being insecure (paranoid principle)

## Definition
Provided by the Cybersecurity Act (EU Regulation 2019/881): **the activities necessary to protect network and information systems, the users of such systems, and other persons affected by cyber threats**


A **cyber threat**: any potential circumstance... **pending**

## Network security
The NIS directive does not use these two definitions but that of **network and information security**: the ability of network and information systems to resist, at a given level of confidence, any action that compromises....  **pending**

The DPCM describes cybersecurity as: the condition whereby cyberspace is protected by the adoption of appropriate **physical, logical and procedural** security measures against events, of a voluntary or accidental nature, consisting in the undue acquisition and transfer of data, their unlawful modification or destruction, or the undue control, damage, destruction or blocking of the regular functioning of networks and information systems or their constituent elements

## Regulatory provisions
