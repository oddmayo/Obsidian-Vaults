# Cryptography

Set of mechanism used to **transform** plaintext messages into an encrypted message

**Cryptanalysis**: study the methods of obtaining the meaning of encrypted information without having access to the secret information that is usually required to perform the operation

## Features of cryptography

Mainly used for: authentication, confidentiality, integrity and anonymity

- Authentication: *identity*
- Confidentiality: *protect*
- Integrity: *originality*
- Anonymity: *untraceable*

## Symmetric cryptography

The **same key** is used for both encryption and decryption operations

It depends solely on the secrecy of the key

## Asymmetric and public key cryptography

It uses a **key pair** for encryption and decryption operations

Public key: encryption operations
private key: decryption operations

It is inherently safe because it uses mathematical-type techniques based on number theory, elliptic curve theory, etc.

### Example

## Deep focus: PGP

Program to encrypt and decrypt e-mail messages. With this program and the problems associated with its export, the debate on what is called the **crypto controversy** begins

## Crypto controversy

Is cryptography an instrument aimed at protecting the privacy of citizens?

Or an instrument designed to evade controls and, therefore, facilitate the commission of wrongdoing?

## Dual-use goods

In the case of cryptography:
- A suitable tool to **protect** one's confidentiality
- A real weapon of **war**

## The Wassenaar Arrangement

Created to **regulate** the export of technologies related to cryptography

Free the export of products that use cryptography systems to protect intellectual property

Anything to specified can be exported under license from the relevant bodies

## The European landscape

These rules summarily apply:
- Export to EU countries is free, except for particular instruments such as, for example, those used for cryptanalysis
- For other countries, either a *Community General Export Authorization* or a *General National License* can be obtained

**Copyright protection**: technological protection measures shall be considered effective where the use of the protected work or material is controller by the owners through the application of an access device or a protection process
