*Data-driven innovation*: enormous benefits for citizens as it is a potential source of growth

- Citizens should be empowered to make better decisions based on insights gleaned from **non-personal data**.
- The EU can become a **leading role model** for society
- EU aims to capture the benefits of better use of data, including greater productivity and competitive markets.

The European data space will give business in the EU the possibility to build on the scale of the Single market:
- Data can flow within the EU and across sectors
- European rules and values, in particular personal data protection
- The rules for access to and use of data are fair, practical and clear

Commission's vision $\rightarrow$ **the human being is and should remain at the center**

By 2030 the aim is to have created a single European data space, a genuine single market for data

The actions are based on **four pillars**:

1. Cross-sectoral governance framework for data access and use
2. Enablers: investments in data and strengthening Europe's capabilities and infrastructures for hosting, processing and using data
3. Competences: empowering individuals, investing in skills and SMEs (small and medium enterprises)
4. Common European data spaces in strategic sectors and domains of public interest

## The world to come
