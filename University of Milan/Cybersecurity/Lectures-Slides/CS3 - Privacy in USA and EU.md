## The two different approach for regulating 'privacy' in USA and EU

EU $\rightarrow$  *omnibus*
USA $\rightarrow$ *sectoral*

Directive 95/46 and Regulation 2016/679: processing of personal information in public and private sectors alike

In the absence of more specific regulation the general #privacy law in EU is able to set the terms for processing, storage and transfer of personal information

## Sectoral regulation

EU: in specific areas such as electronic communications (e-privacy)
USA: only sectoral laws
Other countries looking to adopt privacy legislation based on the EU model

## Council of Europe and European Union

Privacy laws shaped by the CoE and EU

Article 8 of CoE's Convention on Human Rights of 1950 $\rightarrow$ privacy protection as a **critical human right**

---
**ARTICLE 8**
Right to respect for private and family life

Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.

## Nothing to hide

Data can always be interpreted

Privacy protect us from abuses by those in power, even if we're doing nothing wrong

## First definition of privacy

	"The claim of individuals […] to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated". A. Westin

Privacy as an expression of the right to **self-determination** $\rightarrow$ democratic society

## German constitutional Court

	"In the context of modern data processing, the general right of personality […] encompasses the protection of the individual against unlimited collection, storage, use and sharing of personal data. The fundamental right guarantees the authority conferred on the individual to, in principle, decide themselves on the disclosure and use of their personal data"

## Public interest

Limitations of this right to 'informational self-determination' are only permissible if there is an overriding public interest

## Privacy vs Data Protection

privacy $\neq$ data protection

**Data privacy**: defines who has access to data

**Data protection**: provides tools and policies to actually restrict access to the data

In EU we use the expression of data protection

## Charter of Fundamental Right of the European Union

**Article 7** - Respect for private and family life

Everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications

**Article 8** - Protection of personal data

Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her

EU's Lisbon Treaty of 2007 explicitly recognized a right to data protection and also made the charter of Fundamental Rights a legally enforceable document within the EU


## Legal standards for data protection

**Convention 108+**
