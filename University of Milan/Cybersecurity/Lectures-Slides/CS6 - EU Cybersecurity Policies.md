## EU Cybersecurity policies
- Cyber resilience
- Protection of communication (especially 5G) and data
- Secure online society and economy


### Strategy
European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs  - **EU Cybersecurity strategy 2020**

It covers the **security of essential services** such as hospitals, energy grids and railways
It also covers the security of connected objects (*internet of things*)

Respond to major cyberattacks and working with partners to ensure **international security**
*Joint Cyber Unit*: most effective response to threats using collective resources

### Legislation and certification (Directive on security of network and information systems - NIS directive)
Almost always cross-border, and *could affect the EU as a whole*
EU countries need to have strong government bodies that work together
Important for sectors critical for our society

**The NIS Directive** which all countries have now implemented, ensures the creation and cooperation of such government bodies (Reviewed 2020)

### ENISA - the EU cybersecurity agency
**EU agency** that deals with cybersecurity
Support to member States, EU institutions and business key areas - implementation of the NIS directive

### Cybersecurity Act
**Strengthens the role of ENISA**
It has a permanent mandate: stepping up cooperation and crisis management across the EU
Has more financial and human resources than before

### Certification
**General public trust** in the cybersecurity of IT products and services
Check products to meet **high standards**

*The Commission is working for*: EU-wide certification framework with ENISA at its heart - **a single common scheme** (this is contained in the Cybersecurity Act)

## Types of computer security
1. As a **protection of the state**, the EU and critical infrastructure
2. **Protection of the economic system** and activities that rely on the reliability and resilience of electronic communication networks
3. Computer security as **protection of the individual**, his data and his dignity 

## Common elements of European regulations
- Risk based approach
- Accountability of the owner of the information system
- Cooperation between agencies to ensure a safe environment
- Centralization of alerts and control
- Community-level strategy

## General data protection regulation
'Master' of all previous principles

2016/679 of the European Parliament and the Council of 27 April 2016
On the **protection** of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data

## Why a regulation
Before GDPR, the EU data protection law was regulated by a Directive
**Regulation is self-executing across the entire European countries**
Each country must ensure their domestic laws do not conflict with the Regulation's objective

## Harmonization vs uniformity
Harmonize a specific sector across EU; intended to align a specific sector
All technological matters regulated

## Structure of the GDPR
It replaces Directive 95/46/EC and the UK Data Protection Act (1998)
It is the legal **text regulating data protection across EU**, not only Schengen border-free Area

99 articles containing: general provisions, principles, rights of data subject, controller & processor, among others.
