## When are we allowed to process personal data

### Lawful grounds for processing personal data

Article 5 - Principles relating to processing of personal data
$\rightarrow$ **Personal data should be processed lawfully**, fairly and in a transparent way, and it must comply with one of the 6 lawful bases listed in Article 6 [[CS7 - General Data Protection Regulation]]

### Recital 32 GDPR

Consent should be given by a **clear affirmative act** establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement

Silence, pre-ticket boxes or inactivity are not an indication of a free consent

### Methods for obtaining consent
- Tick box
- Signing a declaration/form
- Sending an email
- Selecting Yes/No options
- Oral statement
**GDPR requires data controller to keep evidence of consent**

### Article 7 - conditions of consent

**The controller should be able to demonstrate** that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data

#### Informed consent

Data subject must have sufficient information before exercising his or her choice

**The data controller has to describe in a precise way the processing**

#### Withdraw of consent

The data subject shall have the **right to withdraw his or her consent at any time**
$\rightarrow$ this should not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal

### Performance of a contract

Applies **when the data controller has a contract with a natural person** and needs to process personal data under contract obligations

The contract should be between the data controller and the data subject

### Legal duties of the controller

**Compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject**

Refers to controllers acting in both the private and public sector

### Vital interest of the data subject or of another natural person

**To protect someone's life**

This basis may only be invoked for processing personal data based on the vital interests of another natural person, if such processing "cannot be based on another legal basis"

### Public interest

****"In the exercise of official authority"
- public functions
- tasks in the public interest that are stipulated by the law

### Legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party

**A balancing exercise** must be made between those interests and the interests of fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject

The reasonable expectation of the data subject must be considered

For example: for the purposes of preventing fraud

### Article 9(2) - special categories of personal data

Necessary:

- To carry out the obligations of, and to exercise the specific rights of, the controller or of the data subject in the employment, social security and social protection context
- To protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person
- To establish, exercise or defend **legal claims**
- Medicine purposes
- scientific or historical research

### Subjects of the processing

## Who is a data controller or a data processor?

### Data controller - article 4(7)

**natural or legal person, public authority, agency** or other body which, **alone or jointly** with others, **determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data**

#### The natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body

There is no limitation to the type of entity that can be a controller

It might be an organization, an individual or a group of individuals (usually the organization)

#### Determines

**Controller's influence** over the processing

A controller is a body that decides certain key elements about the processing

May be defined by law or may issue from an analysis of the factual elements or circumstances of the case

#### Alone or jointly with others

Article 4(7) states that the *purposes and means* might be determined by more than one actor

So **several different entities may act as controllers** for the same processing

#### Purposes and means

The **data controller determines the purposes** for which and the means by which personal data is processed
$\rightarrow$ 
*Purpose* is an outcome that is intended or that guides your planned actions
*Means* as how a result is obtained or a scope is achieved

The data controller decides the *why* and *how*

##### Essential and non-essential means

**Essentials** are linked to the purpose and the scope of the processing and are traditionally reserved to the *data controller*

Some examples are the *type* of personal data which are processed, the *duration*, the *categories of recipients* and the *categories of data subjects*

**Non-essentials** concern more practical aspects of implementation, such as the choice for a particular type of software, left to the *data processor*

#### Of the processing of personal data

The concept of a controller can be linked either to a single processing operation or to a set of operations

#### Data controller - Example

When the marketing of the Green company plans to process data for a market survey, the Green company, not the employees of the marketing division, will be the controller of such processing. The marketing division cannot be the controller, as it has no separate identity

A law firm, a lawyer, university of Milan, Doctors...

#### Joint controllers - Article 26

Where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing, they shall be joint controllers

An organizations is a **joint controller** when together with one or more organizations it jointly determines *why* and *how* personal data should be processed

Joint controllers **must agree** upon their responsibilities

For example several research institutes

### Data processor - Article 4(8)

Processor means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which **processes personal data on behalf of the** *controller* and on his instructions

**Two basic conditions**:
1. It is a separate entity in relation to the controller
2. It processes personal data on the controller's behalf

*Acting on behalf of* also means that the processor my not carry out processing for its own purposes, otherwise he may be subject to sanctions

Data processor is usually a **third party external to the organization**

A typical activity of data processor is offering IT solutions, including cloud storage or a payroll company

#### Data processor - Example

A company has many employees. It signs a contract with a payroll company to pay the salaries. 

The company is the data controller and the payroll company is the data processor

### Relationship between controller and processor

The **controller** has the duty to *use only processors providing sufficient guarantees* to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures

The controller is therefore **responsible** for assessing the adequacy of the guarantees provided by the processor:

1. Expert knowledge of the processor
2. The processor's resources
3. The reputation of the processor on the market

---

The duties of the processor towards the controller must be specified in a **contract**, which is a **legal requirement**

**Definition of contract**: A written or spoken agreement, that is intended to be enforceable by law, and must include:
- a subject of matter
- the nature and the purpose of the processing
- the duration of the processing
- the type of personal data
- the categories of data subjects

It also should stipulate the controller's and the processor's obligations and rights and the documented instructions from the controller

---

The processor must keep records and be made available to the *supervisory authority at its request*

### Sub-processors

The data processor might want to delegate some tasks to **another processor**, the so called **sub-processors**, for which case he need an authorization

If a sub-processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, the initial processor remains fully liable to the controller

### Responsibilities and obligations of the data controller

The data controller must determine:
- The **legal basis** for collecting data
- Which kind of personal data are collected
- The purpose of purposes the data is to be used for
- Which individuals can collect personal data
- Whether to disclose the data and, if so, to whom
- Whether third parties could access to personal data
- How long to retain the data for

It has to comply with Article 5; be responsible and be able to**demonstrate compliance** with the 6 principles

### Accountability

**Responsibility of the controller - Art- 24**: the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to **ensure** and be able to **demonstrate** that processing is performed in accordance with this Regulation

Implementation of appropriate data protection policies by the controller

Maintain relevant documentation on processing activities

### Data protection impact assessment (DPIA)

It is required when:
- using new technologies
- profiling
- surveilling
- process of special categories of personal data
- processing is likely to result in risk to rights and freedoms of individuals

Any processing that results in a **high risk to the right to privacy** or the protection **requires a DPIA**

---

*GDPR* includes provisions that **promote accountability and governance**

*Data controllers and data processor* are expected to put into place comprehensive but **proportionate governance measures**. Good practice tools such as privacy impact assessments and privacy by design are now legally required in certain circumstances

These measures should **minimize the risk** of breaches and uphold the protection of personal data
